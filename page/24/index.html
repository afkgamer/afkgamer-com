				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>When last we left HunterSister, she and that one man-whore paladin in my guild were dating.  (<a href="https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/archives/2007/05/10/the-harassed-becomes-the-harasser/">Here&#8217;s when last we left HunterSister</a>)  Well, they <em>were</em> dating &#8212; and you know when I say &#8220;dating&#8221; that&#8217;s just a code word for screwing and posting sappy, gaussian-blurred photos on our guild site &#8212; and then ALLEGEDLY she was whacked and game-stalking him and we laughed because goddamn, everyone saw that coming.</p>
<p>So I guess that didn&#8217;t work out (shocking), and our man-whore paladin moved on to other female gamers, eventually landing on (pun!) a female paladin in our guild.</p>
<p>Now, this gal was an interesting character.  Friendly, outgoing, and a reasonably skilled player (that&#8217;s code for &#8220;kinda sucked, but not enough to get kicked&#8221;).  After about a week of guild membership, she&#8217;s comfortable enough with us to reveal more of her personality, which is somewhat clever sexual innuendos and occasional bawdiness.  Who doesn&#8217;t love bawdy?  I love bawdy, I&#8217;ll bet you do too.  </p>
<p>Un-for-tun-ate-ly, one of the consequences of a female gamer working bawdy humor is unwanted attention.  I saw a few things in /guildchat that gave me pause, and I wondered if it bothered her, but she would carry on like there was no harm.  Cool, because I hate policing the guild.</p>
<p>Then, late winter 2007, we had this huge guild meeting in Ventrilo.  Planned agenda:  the future, namely raiding, recruiting, downsizing (that was my agenda item because goddamn, we were just TOO BIG for a max 25-man raid scheme), and restructuring of guild leadership.  Actual agenda:  airing of grievances.  </p>
<p>One of those grievances, which took up AN HOUR OF DISCUSSION TIME, was that bawdy paladin girl didn&#8217;t appreciate the similarly bawdy (my opinion) comments made in return.  Summarized:  she didn&#8217;t like the inappropriate comments made to her and the guild dudes often stepped over the (invisible) line when talking to her.  And of course, the gentlemen officership expressed GREAT ALARM and rushed to comfort her while scolding the rest of us.  Truly, most of us knew exactly who she was probably talking about &#8212; the suspects had tried to initiate outrageous conversations with other guild women in the past, however, when rebuffed, the suspects had ceased and never bothered those women again.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t that ok?  It is in my opinion.  Someone says something that someone else doesn&#8217;t want to talk about, the someone else says stop, and the offensive someone stops.  Another crisis averted!</p>
<p>So, I asked her, who are we talking about, and did you ask them to stop?  And, of course, as is the way of modern times, she doesn&#8217;t want to say who it is, and yes she did ask him/them to stop and he/they didn&#8217;t.  Christ.  I really hate that.  Some dude(s) is sexually harassing her or borderline harassing and she won&#8217;t say who.  How are we supposed to deal with that?  Here&#8217;s how we did deal with that:  Hey guys, don&#8217;t sexually harass anyone.  Kthx!</p>
<p>Talk about an edict with no teeth.  (I mean, duh?)</p>
<p>She seemed satisfied and the meeting crawled forward.</p>
<p>Few weeks after that, there&#8217;s this new level 65-ish druid in the guild and I asked the officers why in the hell were we recruiting new people when we&#8217;re already obese with members, and further, why in the hell were we inviting low levels??  Oh, that&#8217;s the bawdy paladin&#8217;s real life husband.</p>
<p>!!!</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Why don&#8217;t I just tell you?</p>
<p>Remember that one dude who was guildleader of (yet another) guild that hates my guild and he <em>claimed</em> he got hacked and/or keylogged and, what a world! what a world!, their phat guildbank is gone and they might have to start whoring themselves for a living to survive in Le World of Warcraft?  Well &#8230; whoring more, if that were at all possible.  (<a href="https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/archives/2007/08/14/heres-lots-of-stupid/">Link</a> if you need a refresher.)</p>
<p>So, he had tried for a few weeks to prop up his &#8220;I&#8217;ve been HACKED!  and/or KEYLOGGED!&#8221; story for a week or two on my realm forums, and of course all of us were doing the &#8220;uh huh, sure&#8221;, and his guildmates were licking ass and telling us haters to stfu.  And then, suddenly, he dropped off the face of the Earth.  </p>
<p>A month went by without a word from him to his guildmates.  We know this because we&#8217;d politely inquire of his guildmates and they said they hadn&#8217;t heard from him in weeks.  </p>
<p>(That&#8217;s not suspicious at all.  No way.)</p>
<p>And so, after weeks of no communication, his guildmates scattered to the winds and transferred to different servers or joined other raiding guilds, like mine, and that one dude became just a story we told our younger members who, often times, take every game character at face value.  </p>
<p>Last week, some of our members got tells from &#8220;That One Dude&#8221; and he explained that he did get his account back from Blizzard after an EXHAUSTIVE investigation and he had server transferred and changed his character name.  (As you do.)  Despite several direct inquiries, he refused to disclose his new name or server &#8230; because &#8220;he didn&#8217;t want all that drama to follow him&#8221;, and he wished everyone well or something ridiculous like that.   </p>
<p>Are these the actions of an innocent character?  Several of his former guildmates <del datetime="2007-10-02T19:22:09+00:00">think</del> thought so.  </p>
<p>So.  Being the fucking guerilla master that I am, I resolve to get to the bottom of this cuz I&#8217;m tired of being labeled a hater cuz I won&#8217;t swallow bullshit.  </p>
<p>Fortunately for me, some of his friends ratted out the thieving bastard and named the new server, and again fortunately for me, he&#8217;s as stupid as he is dishonest and he renamed his character similarly, although not quite searchable without more info, thereby saving me several hours (days) of fruitless hunting.  Ba da bing, I have the server, I have the name, and now, thanks armory!, I have the guild.</p>
<p>And with the guild, which has forums, and a searchable member list with join dates, I now have the date he first expressed an interest in this other guild on a server far, far away from his own guild &#8212; a date one week prior to the day he claimed that he was HACKED!  and/or KEYLOGGED!  Why &#8230; it&#8217;s almost as if he planned the whole thing.</p>
<p>Ya&#8217;know, it&#8217;s almost not fair how smart I am compared to the average gamer.  It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m that Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#8217;s Court and I can frighten the superstitious populace with my superior knowledge of a solar eclipse.  It&#8217;s magic, be afraid!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to me how otherwise (mostly) honest people assume a fake name in a game, and sometimes a fake personality, and their dishonest, thieving nature comes to light.   It&#8217;s doubly interesting that there&#8217;s always apologists and hive minds to defend them.  His original story didn&#8217;t even make sense and yet, there they were, buzzing around his level one posting alt calling the rest of us jealous haters.  </p>
<p>The things some players will do, the things they will believe, all for loot &#8212; future loot, the hope of loot, the fond memory of past loot &#8212; that&#8217;s the magic.</p>
<p>Tomorrow:  Meh, I ran out of time to tell you about the continuing woes of hunter sister and our man-whore paladin.  I&#8217;ll save that one for tomorrow, plus &#8230; BabbleOn is back!!  She&#8217;s still not speaking to us.  Yet.</p>

			<p>I took a short blog vacation while I was traveling, as I&#8217;m wont to do, plus, there&#8217;s always a million things to do when a monster patch falls from the sky, like updating addons from traffic-challenged sites and laughing at the emo warrior who logs off in disgust on patch day because he can&#8217;t even get Omen installed properly (true story) or how about dealing with the new sound system that screws Ventrilo quality if you don&#8217;t follow the now-proper sequence of loading and connecting to Ventrilo FIRST and then World of Warcraft.  </p>
<p>How can I stealth log in on a super secret alt if I connect to Ventrilo first???  Ya, I can&#8217;t.  Which is yet another reason why I hate this new sound system.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure I can think of a single thing I like about Patch 2.2.0.  Wait a minute, I&#8217;ll go read the notes again.  (You can read along <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Patch_2.2.0">here</a>.)</p>
<p>I like 30 minute paladin buffs.  And I LOVE the afk-reporting system in the battlegrounds.  So much potential for abuse, which is really appealing to me.  (Here&#8217;s <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2043490712&#038;sid=1">the story of someone who appreciates the art of abuse</a> more than I do.)</p>
<p>Patch 2.3 seems like a brighter world, but I&#8217;ve noticed that Blizzard doesn&#8217;t give with the one hand unless it takes away with the other.  I think it has to do with formulas.  Y&#8217;know math.  Can&#8217;t argue with math.  (Excellent 2.3 thread <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=1778027018&#038;sid=1">here</a>, with citations for quoted material.)</p>
<p>In light of recent class &#8220;balancing&#8221; (or lack thereof), this thread is amusing:  <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2043720833&#038;sid=1">DEV LIST of toons/class played</a></p>
<p>The setup:</p>
<blockquote><p>I would love to see a list of DEVS and the race/class of toon they play. Just curious.<br />
I am assuming I will never see that though.</p></blockquote>
<p>And the punchline:</p>
<blockquote><p>Warlock<br />
Warlock<br />
Paladin<br />
Warlock<br />
Warlock<br />
Mace Spec MS Warrior<br />
Warlock<br />
Warlock<br />
Warlock<br />
Resto Druid<br />
Warlock<br />
Warlock<br />
Warlock</p></blockquote>
<p>Which can&#8217;t be that far from the truth.  Either that, or the dude playing a warlock is one helluva persuasive sonuvagun.</p>
<p><strong>Later:</strong>  Drama updates, because I know you&#8217;re dying to hear whatever became of that crazy hunter chick who was dating the paladin in our guild, who dumped her then started seeing that paladin chick in another guild and it was shortly after that when we realized it might not be the chicks who are crazy and emo and My Chemical Romance all over the place.</p>
