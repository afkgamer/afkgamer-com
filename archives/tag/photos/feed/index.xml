<p>Of course, I could have bought a 12-pack of this &#8220;DEW WITH AN INVIGORATING BLAST OF CITRUS CHERRY FLAVOR <em>with other natural flavors</em>&#8221; &#8230; after all, LIMITED EDITION &#8230; but I&#8217;d rather just have the photo and take the risk that my gaming won&#8217;t be all that it could be.  No doubt liquor has more to do with that than a lack of invigorating citrus cherry flavor.</p>

You Americans!  Move away from the keyboard and go vote.</p>
<p>You have time, it&#8217;s &#8220;Vacuum out the Warcraft Servers&#8221; day.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m way ahead of ya, though.  Voted this morning on the way to work.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll share my super leet strat for voting &#8212; unless there&#8217;s evidence to the contrary, every incumbent is a crook, and the longer they&#8217;re in office, the more likely they are to be crooked.  </p>
<p>I look at it this way, I&#8217;m doing them a FAVOR by sending them home.  Let some new guy have a chance, that&#8217;s my vote.</p>
<p>Whatever your leet strat is, get out there and do eet.  If you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll have no one to blame but yourself.  And the Republicans.  (I&#8217;m kidding.)</p>
<p>P.S.  Here&#8217;s some <a href="http://www.pollingplacephotoproject.org/content.cfm/browse_photographs">pics from polling places</a> across the nation via the AIGA Polling Place Photo Project.  I would have snapped a few at my polling place, but the scary goth election judge looked like the type who would jump the table and crack my skull with the camera.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few people changing bedfellows last week:  Sigil Games Online, developer of Vanguard, is now <a href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/news_article.vm?id=50144">partnered up with Sony Online</a> and <a href="http://www.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=3;mid=114668646932202500;num=0;page=1#114669257870148234">Allakh-popup is now an IGE affiliate</a>.  Mr. Allakh-ad wrote, &#8220;The ownership issues here are convoluted.  This is how deals like this get done.&#8221;  Dude, whatever.  I&#8217;m with you:  Fuck pride.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afkgamer/143421622/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/45/143421622_56b0f57200_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="CGM Vanguard Cover" class="alignleft" /></a>Back to Vanguard, Microsoft is getting out while the getting&#8217;s good.  Based on the HORRIFIC beta buzz swirling around Vanguard, it&#8217;s not a moment too soon.  That&#8217;s me being blunt.  </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s me being nice:  Microsoft and Sigil had irreconciliable artistic differences.  Now, Sony and Sigil can have artistic differences.  </p>
<p>Did you want to get into the closed beta and try out Vanguard for yourself?  Let me rephrase that.  Did you want to get into the queue for Vanguard&#8217;s beta but for some reason you haven&#8217;t signed up on the Vanguard forums already?  </p>
<p>Here ya go:  the latest issue, June 2006, of <em>Computer Games Magazine</em> includes <a href="http://www.cgonline.com/index.php?option=com_content&#038;task=view&#038;id=550&#038;Itemid=0">a code that will give you exclusive access to the Vanguard beta (queue)</a>.  Plus, there&#8217;s pictures.</p>
<p>Heh, a couple of guys in my Warcraft guild went out Monday to pick up a copy, excited to give Vanguard a try.  They weren&#8217;t too pleased about the queue thing since that&#8217;s not very evident from the cover.  They tried to convince a few more guildies to get in the queue so we can have a merry little band running around in Vanguard.</p>
<p>This was me being nice:  I don&#8217;t have $5 to spare this month on a computer mag.</p>

(I dunno, it&#8217;s some game thing, supposed to be good for you.)</p>
<p>Few things I thought of this week:  #1 &#8211; I&#8217;m not big on the future.  I&#8217;m not much interested in what I might be able to buy some day.  Tell me what I can buy NOW.  </p>
<p>#2 &#8211; I hope no one ever writes a book called <strong>The Mathematics of Multiplayer Online Gaming</strong> because what a snooze that would be.</p>
<p>#3 &#8211; Please, please, please announce the new Alliance race for the World of Warcraft expansion soon.  I&#8217;m not much interested, but I&#8217;m tired of the speculation and rumors.  We all are.  End it already.  (UPDATE:  Thank God that&#8217;s over.  It&#8217;s Draenei.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/09/technology/10warcraft.web.html?ex=1304827200&#038;en=3a679d1103134e90&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss">NYT wouldn&#8217;t print it if it wasn&#8217;t true</a>.  Also, longish <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/09/technology/10warcraftqa.web.html">NYT interview with Blizzard&#8217;s (Tigole) Jeff Kaplan</a>.)</p>
<p>#4 &#8211; There&#8217;s no way in Hell I will spend $500 and change on a game system unless it will blow me too.  What functions could said system possibly perform, short of the aforementioned blowing, that my other pieces of electronica can&#8217;t do already?  None, that&#8217;s what.  </p>
<p>#5 &#8211; This porta-crapper reminded me of the new Nintendo controller, Wii, the subject of much hype-o-drama at the E3 this year.  I came back the next day to get a photo.  That&#8217;s how dedicated to my craft I am.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve been following the cat fight between Smed, he of SOE fame, and Penny Arcade, the lifestyle center, Gabe (PA&#8217;s L. Ron Hubbard) has photos and a short post about the <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/2006/03/01/">1,200 Krispy Kreme donuts they received yesterday</a> from Smed and SOE.  Here&#8217;s the cat fight so far:  Smed upset with what PA said, PA upset with what SOE said, mmm donuts, SOE makes the lifestyle center&#8217;s news page again.  If those girls don&#8217;t stop picking on each other, one of them is going to develop an eating disorder.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I haven&#8217;t been a fanboi of anything for a long time.  I was an EverQuest fanboi before launch &#8212; Anarchy Online, Dark Age of Camelot, same thing &#8212; then I slunk back to EQ like the junkie I was, and, it was around that time that fanboi joy was over for me.  &#8220;This game is gonna be great!&#8221; had long since turned to &#8220;I really hope this game doesn&#8217;t suck.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, I am a <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> fanboi and have been for at least a year and a half.  Of course, Flickr is not a game, so that probably explains that, but it is (their words) &#8220;&#8230; almost certainly the best online photo management and sharing application in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/afkgamer/">Flickr pro account for AFK Gamer</a> (which you can see), and another Flickr pro account for real life photos (which you can&#8217;t see).  Most days, I&#8217;ll throw up a screenshot or two on Flickr that won&#8217;t make the cut for a post here.  You&#8217;re welcome to poke around there, OF COURSE, cuz Flickr is all about sharing for people that like to watch.</p>
<p>One of the things I do while waiting in a game queue is follow the Flickr gaming tags and check out other people&#8217;s screenshots.  Here&#8217;s a few to get you started if you&#8217;re like me and you like to watch:</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/worldofwarcraft/">WorldofWarcraft tag</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/worldofwarcraft/interesting/">Most interesting WorldofWarcraft</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/everquest2/">Everquest2 tag</a>,  <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/everquest2/interesting/">Most interesting Everquest2</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/guildwars/">Guild Wars tag</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/ragnaros/">Ragnaros (the bastard of Molten Core) tag</a>, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups_search.gne?q=gaming+screenshots">Flickr interest groups for gaming screenshots</a>.</p>
<p>There are even gaming guilds/clans that have a Flickr group for their members to share screenshots and photos, which, by my way of thinking, makes Flickr a killer guild app, too &#8212; unfortunately, not for my guild.  We&#8217;re still working on How to Register for the DKP Site 101.</p>
