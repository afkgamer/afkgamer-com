			<p>(CAUTION:  Before I link this interview with WoWarcraft&#8217;s Mr. Didier and Tigole (aka Mrs. Kaplan&#8217;s son) from the Games Convention in Leipzig, I&#8217;ll warn you that this site set off bells and whistles in my Firefox NoScript.  So don&#8217;t click if you&#8217;re an extra cautious type.  I&#8217;ve uploaded a <a href="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1286/1276285682_f8092f24c8_o.jpg">screenshot of the page</a> to Flickr and you can read the entire interview there.)</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=170930&#038;skip=yes">an interview</a> at the Leipzig Games Convention with WoWarcraft&#8217;s senior art director Sam Didier and lead designer Jeffrey Kaplan (Tigole) by ComputerandVideoGames.com&#8217;s Stuart Bishop &#8212; Tigole said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The big lesson we learned from The Burning Crusade was that our ten-person instances are extremely popular. So for Wrath of the Lich King we wanted progression in the ten-person raid game for the players&#8230; who want to stick to that ten-person cap. </p></blockquote>
<p>Well dammit boys, you learned the wrong lesson.  You completely missed the most important lesson of The Burning Crusade, that is &#8220;The Karazhan Mistake&#8221;.  And really, how could you miss it?  I don&#8217;t know &#8212; I guess because you&#8217;re listening to the neo-uber guilds STILL, instead of the meat of the raiding bell curve.  </p>
<p>Nevertheless.  Since you all failed that portion of the final exam, let&#8217;s go over the material again (with some added explanations for the non-WoW people):</p>
<p>Karazhan is a 10-man instance with a reset timer of one week.  It is firmly placed in the line of gear progression.  Technically, you could skip Kara gear and step right into the first 25-man instances, I suppose, if you had a guild composed entirely of messiahs, prophets and gods.  (Hint:  none of us do.)</p>
<p>Therefore, since we all had to do Karazhan at some point, every guild either had to run multiple simultaneous weekly Karazhan raids with guildmembers tied to a single raid ID (no swapping of guildmates to the other guild Kara raids), OR, they ran a single Karazhan over and over and over and over many weeks to gear everyone up for the 25-man raids.</p>
<p>Was this fun?  (Imagine I drew a huge question mark on the whiteboard at this point.)  NO IT WAS NOT.  I&#8217;ll pause while you take some notes.  No pen or paper?  Crimony.  Never go into class or into the boss&#8217;s office without pens (plural) and paper.  Write that down too.</p>

			<p>Continuing the theme of guildmembers behaving badly, AND letting the emailers do all the work, Chicogrande found this derailed recruitment thread on the World of Warcraft forums:  <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=965511715&#038;sid=1&#038;pageNo=1">Rebirth is recruiting raid member</a>.  </p>
<p>So Rebirth of the Eonar server is looking for some more raiders and they explain a little bit about their guild and how to contact them.  The very first reply is from disgruntled former guild member Aleksander, level 70 flavor of the year (warlock):</p>
<blockquote><p>JOIN AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!! I learned alot of things while Guilded under the Influence of Rebirth&#8230;.. Lets see here&#8230;&#8230;.</p>
<p>1. You will Take alot of sheet from the guild leader he will practiclly make you a Puppet&#8230;..</p>
<p>2. You cannot Raid with Crappy Gear. by crappy gear&#8230; there is a rogue in the guild who is half epiced out and it is good gear even the stuff that isn&#8217;t epics but he wasn&#8217;t taken as often as he should have been due to the fact that there are better equipped rogues in the guild and as far as gear goes this doesn&#8217;t pertain to just rogues&#8230; it goes for ALL classes</p>
<p>3. If your a rogue, you will Get DENIED. because they got that part covered.</p>
<p>4. THEY DON&#8217;T JOKE AROUND. Sooo if you tell one of them You want to PUG there wife they will KICK YOU OUT. ( I talk from Experience. )</p>
<p>5. Loot &#8211; No DKP system in place yet. They are raiding Karazhan. So how does loot work. Well let me explain. First of all they have two groups for Karazhan. You might as well consider yourself a part of group 2 since group 1 is normally the officers unless someone leaves and they need another person. Anyways you go and kill Curator for example. The Officers will debate on who they think EARNED the gear and give it to them. Don&#8217;t even plan on having a shot at rolling on it. I have personally tried to pass some gear to mages who needed it more than I did and they said no it&#8217;s yours take it and gave it to me. Expect to see this happen</p>
<p>6. No One will Ever Help you&#8230;&#8230;. Only Real True Friends Will&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. and it takes a long time to get them here&#8230;&#8230; cause everyone is Trying to gear up&#8230;.. Soo no time to help with anything.</p>
<p>7. And the Last but not Least&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; See Number 4.</p>
<p>Only Good thing i can say, there are alot of Really Nice People here&#8230;&#8230;. Thats all&#8230;.</p>
<p>Sorry Ode&#8230;&#8230; It just Wasn&#8217;t Fair. to get booted for saying i want to PUG his Wife. LOL.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wow.  How outrageous.  He made a comment about some guy&#8217;s wife and he got booted.  </p>
<p>FUCKING DUH, you twit!  Make a comment about their mothers or sisters, cousins, gay lovers, anyone except the wife or girlfriend.  Isn&#8217;t that something you learn on your own?  Are games somehow attracting people with almost zero social experience in the real world?  There sure are a lot of them with MMOG accounts.</p>
<p>Anyways, the warlock continues to unhinge and explains that what he meant was the guy&#8217;s wife is a MILF (we all know that&#8217;s VERY flattering) and he knows that other guilds are conspiring against him in the thread, including his current one (reply #83):</p>
<blockquote><p><small>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />
Q u o t e:<br />
Aleksander&#8230; I don&#8217;t even know what to say.</p>
<p>I want to make this perfectly clear. If I were still an officer of Fusion, I would gkick you. Immediately. Your behavior on this thread is rediculous, and you&#8217;re making your guild, a guild I am still quite fond of, look like a bunch of idiots and degenerates. With all my heart, I must say</p>
<p>SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS<br />
TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT<br />
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF<br />
UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</small></p>
<p>How about this&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; Your an Idiot&#8230;&#8230;. Did i make myself clear??? My Behavior?? What about your Behavior?? you Post on something your not even part of&#8230;. Jeez&#8230;&#8230;.</p>
<p>you want to throw your 5 cents? WIll it make You Look like a HERO??? Dude your a Dumb SHEET Just Like everyone else Who Posted against me&#8230;&#8230;.. Seriously Kids&#8230;&#8230; this gone Far enough&#8230;&#8230;..</p>
<p>S<br />
T<br />
F<br />
U</p>
<p>And burn in Hell&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; you Wankers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sometimes one lobotomy just isn&#8217;t enough.</p>

			<p>Today, my emailers do all the work for me and bird dog some World of Warcraft forum fun.</p>
<p>Emailer Indy (who never goes on an adventure without a hat) found some loot drama on the Hunter forums from a disgruntled Karazhan raider:  <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=1230364365&#038;sid=1&#038;pageNo=1">/sigh .. Q about raiding loot</a>.  </p>
<p>As Indy noted and as you can see, Fubarius, level 70 hunter of the Vashj realm, posted his loot QQ from his main account and *GASP!* word got back to the guild.  Fubarius, model guild citizen and stellar raider wrote:</p>

A hunter in my guild is a female character and female IRL. Her husband is kind of a main healer and she gets ALL the hunter loot. She&#8217;s a complete &#8220;Loot !**##&#8221;<br />
When she got the t4 legs they said in vent &#8220;So ____ how many blow jobs did it take you to get that?&#8221;<br />
Basically she kisses up.</p>
<p>Is this fair? I lost all the tier gear to her. It&#8217;s really not fair, i&#8217;m stuck in mostly full blues while she rocks the epics.. /sigh </p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, yes, calling an officer&#8217;s (real life) wife a whore is a good idea!</p>
<p>Bla bla, some replies about the pros and cons of loot councils and DKP systems that we don&#8217;t care about and then BOOM, The Guild arrives:</p>
<p>Page 3, reply #40, Infamous, level 70 warrior of Fubarius&#8217; guild has a different opinion:</p>
<blockquote><p>actually its not because shes a female. when we were considering who to give the tier5 shoulders, the only time your name came up was when every1 decided who was NOT getting them.</p>
<p>personally i picked drakko for tier5 but she has been to SLIGHTLY more raids and the other officers wanted her to have them instead, i just wanted to get on with some more loot so i shrugged and let them lootmaster it to her.</p>
<p>anyway after reading this, i was gonna wait til u logged on to gkick u, but a certain paladin spoiled my fun immediately after reading what i said.</p>
<p>u dont deserve tier 4 ANYTHING, i raided in apocalypse for 2 months and only got tier4 gloves cuz rootz thought i perma respecced prot, u are surely not getting tier 5 shoulders after raiding for like 1month and crying the whole time while contributing NOTHING.</p>
<p>did u ever farm those primals? did u ever raise your tradeskills like we asked u to? looking in my mail RIGHT NOW, i can see that she sent me nightmare seed and her husband sent me some +30 stamina buff food. is that called sucking up? no, its called using tradeskills to benefit the guild, i am a maintank so i use these things to win fights and get people loot. i am a blacksmith and i bring sharpening stones, u know this because time after time u have opened a trade window on me and time after time i have given u one just for that lil extra bit of crit that might help turn a near wipe into a victory. however that does us no good when u die on every karazhan fight, but thats another story.</p>
<p>u never even deserved Legacy over her, u just took advantage of her kindness in letting u sub in for her, and that was Astriel&#8217;s decision not mine. he has since regretted it as much as i have. she is one of the least greedy people i have raided with, she had asked many times to have her tier tokens passed to her friend (a gnome mage) but we decided against it cuz of other items being available.</p>
<p>sorry hunters im not trying to incite forum drama, im just trying to clear my guilds name. nubarius here has long been something of a joke on this server, we decided to give him one &#8220;last chance&#8221; by inviting him into this guild and look how it turned out.<br />
he wipes us constantly with his terrible pulling and trapping, he ninja looted fiend slayer boots from chess event before we made the loot decision, he even logged off after void reaver and logged in vent to listen during doomwalker without taking part in the fight and i was willing to see past all that. but making a whiny loot %#**% thread like this was the last straw. i told u numerous times to step your game up and to stop this forum business, thank u for proving that u are incapable of doing either.</p>
<p>oh yea to respond to some of the replys i saw while glancin thru, shes not an officers wife, and fubarius lost the last few &#8220;friends&#8221; he had on this server by making this thread. the way he acts in this game, i wouldnt be surprised if he doesnt have any friends in real life either.</p>
<p>that should about cover everything, feel free to remind me if i left anything out fubarius</p></blockquote>
<p>So.  We learned that calling a guildmate&#8217;s wife a whore on a public forum from our main account is a bad idea.  Actually, WE didn&#8217;t learn that, we already knew that.  Maybe Fubarius learned that though.  Maybe.</p>
