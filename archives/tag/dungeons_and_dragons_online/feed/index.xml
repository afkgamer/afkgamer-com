								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oh.  I forgot to give a nod to <a href="http://www.ddo.com/index.php?page_id=20&#038;pagebuilder[module]=article&#038;pagebuilder[display_item]=384">Dungeons &#038; Dragons Online that launched this week</a>.  Max level 10 (woohoo!), steep leveling curve (booo!), $50 box price (meh), $15 a month to play (pfffft!) and there be ELVES (hooray!).  I played a few nights in one of the DDO beta events; got a few levels on my character (a rogue, duh) and shook some of the noob stink off of me.  I didn&#8217;t think it was a bad little game, what little I experienced; didn&#8217;t think it was an awesome little game either.  Maybe it&#8217;s one of those games that will age well, like Eve Online.  (Succinctly:  we used to have Eve Online jokes and now we don&#8217;t.)</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/images/DDO.jpg" width="470" height="100" alt="Dungeons &#038; Dragons" /></p>
<p>This Saturday, November 5, 2005, is <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dnd/20050726x">Worldwide Dungeons &#038; Dragons Game Day</a>.  You have to actually leave your house to participate.  (GOD NO!)  And, of course, D &#038; D involves pencil and paper and dice (GOD NO!) &#8230; real old skool stuff.</p>
<p>As Dungeons &#038; Dragons is the grandfather of MMO fantasy games (Hail, Lord Nagafen!), I will participate in my own way &#8230; buried in a Warcraft dungeon that may or may not contain dragons.  Wouldn&#8217;t know it by us, some raids.  Dungeon appears to be full of trash mobs, there be dragons??  </p>
<p>Anyways.  If you&#8217;re a FilePlanet subscriber, or your e-friend is a subscriber, D &#038; D Online has <a href="http://www.fileplanet.com/promotions/ddo_stormreach/">prioritized beta apps available</a>.  Be sure to login first, else you&#8217;ll have to fill out the app twice.  As is typical, they want to know your gaming resume, and if you work for a fansite, game pub or in the industry.  Technically, I didn&#8217;t lie.  Remember that.</p>
<p>While reading around the net about D &#038; D history, I ran across <a href="http://www.chick.com/articles/frpg.asp">this dandy site with some Christian game writing</a>.  The author&#8217;s original D &#038; D piece, <a href="http://www.chick.com/articles/dnd.asp">&#8220;Straight Talk on Dungeons &#038; Dragons&#8221;</a>, is also &#8230; interesting.  </p>
<p>I like to start off my day with at least a couple of the deadly sins.  (For the record, that was:  pride, anger, greed and sloth plus a few mortal sins for diversification.)</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to Betas, use a scattershot approach &#8212; apply for everything, *maybe* you&#8217;ll get invited to one thing.</p>
<p>Another target to keep in your sights, one of the incoming Turbine elf dramas:  Dungeons &#038; Dragons Online <a href="http://www.ddo.com/index.php?page_id=66&#038;pagebuilder[module]=article&#038;pagebuilder[display_item]=113">pre-beta beta signup</a>.  Really, you have GOT to get into the beta if you want bragging rights for your entire stay in a game:  I was in the beta, I&#8217;m as old skool as it gets, noob.  Also:  Game was much better in the closed beta without all these noobs.</p>
<p>Or, you can lie like most people and just say you were in beta plus you&#8217;re drinking buddies with the developers so of course you&#8217;d know how this damn encounter works.  Jeezus.</p>
<p>In other elvish news, the rumors continue to grow and mutate about World of Warcraft&#8217;s first expansion pack (read:  content you have to BUY) &#8212; the details will be officially announced at their BlizzCon thingy on October 28 and 29.  Missed the rumors?  Go read:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.joystiq.com/entry/1234000690064330/">Joystiq</a><br />
<a href="http://www.gamingsteve.com/archives/2005/10/world_of_warcra_1.php">Gaming Steve</a><br />
<a href="http://www.wowguru.com/forums/showthread.php?p=55141">WoW Guru forum post by some guy</a><br />
<a href="http://www.cesspit.net/drupal/node/953">The Cesspit</a> and <a href="http://www.cesspit.net/drupal/node/954">updated Cesspit</a>.  (and how the fuck did Vivendi get Abalieno&#8217;s phone number?)</p>
<p>The big thing is, of course, the max level increase.  Seeing as how &#8220;learning from others&#8217; past mistakes&#8221; isn&#8217;t a strong point around these parts, this could be painful &#8230; for everyone.  One word:  Kunark.</p>
<p>But!  The bright side:  we all get to return to the level grind.  Yay.  Plus, there&#8217;ll be more elves.  Yay.  </p>
<p>If the horde really does get a new blood elf race, there goes all our Alliance chick priests and druids.  Sure, there&#8217;ll be less chatter about shoulder and helm graphics, but we need all the priests and druids we can get.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my e-mailbox today, (my real life email, not my AFK Gamer mailbox &#8212;  Foton doesn&#8217;t shill for anyone except Foton.):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cityofvillains.com/">City of Villains</a> &#8212; Preorders available from selected retailers (EB Games, Game Stop, CompUSA and Best Buy).  Includes:  beta access, two-day head-start before it ships to the public (you know you want that, you gaming whore!), an exclusive in-game item (any chance that won&#8217;t suck?), some limited edition poster, 14-day free trial of City of Heroes for you and one of your imaginary friends, and a CD-ROM with art and shit. </p>
<p>I checked the Game Stop link (Hail, click through!), preorder is 50 bucks with an ETA of October 31, 2005.</p>
<p>So, we have that going for us.  Which is nice.</p>
<p>Also, the somewhat anticipated <a href="http://www.ddo.com/index.php?page_id=66&#038;pagebuilder[module]=article&#038;pagebuilder[display_item]=84">Dungeons &#038; Dragons Online sent out alpha invites</a> recently, with promises of additional invites in the (near?) future.  (Found on <a href="http://www.betawatcher.com/index.aspx">Betawatcher</a>.  FFS, I don&#8217;t start camping a game website until closed beta approaches.)</p>
<p>Turbine SAYS the DDO <a href="http://www.ddo.com/index.php?page_id=63">ETA is the second half of 2005</a>, which, to me, means &#8230; they need to get that bitch out in time for Christmas.</p>
<p>Meh.  I don&#8217;t even know if I&#8217;ll bother with either.  </p>
<p>(You don&#8217;t believe that shit, do you?  You KNOW I&#8217;ll try them both like the gaming whore I am.)</p>
