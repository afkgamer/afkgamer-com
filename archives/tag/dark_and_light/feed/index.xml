								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dark and Light, self-titled largest MMORPG you&#8217;ve ever seen, became available for all takers this week with a <a href="http://www.darkandlight.com/en_play-dark-and-light-with-or.html">two-tier subscription system</a>:  Free with limited access and abilities, $14.99 a month for unlimited.  I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll fork over $55 to download and try a game I&#8217;ve heard almost nothing about &#8212; except from the German dude who was in my Star Wars: Galaxies PVP guild way back when &#8212; but I like the free or not system.  From the official site, <a href="http://www.darkandlight.com/-races-.html">available races</a>:  ELVES!  Four flavors of elves!  Plus, Dark and Light humans will mate with just about anything it seems:  demigods, elves, orcs, trolls, occasionally other humans &#8230;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Looks like you can join the <a href="http://www.darkandlight.net/sog/indexEN.html">Dark and Light</a> beta in November, the so-called Settlers of Ganareth, with limited pre-orders available for the expected full release in April 2006:</p>
<blockquote><p>This Dark and Light prelude will be free to access. Also a limited number of Dark and Light game keys will be available from November via pre-ordering, and this will give access to an inevitable pack of features. Keep your eyes open, Dark and Light, the genesis, is on its way! </p></blockquote>
<p>What&#8217;s inevitable about the pack of features?  We won&#8217;t want them, but hell, it&#8217;s inevitable and we should get used to it?  And why limited?  They&#8217;d refuse anyone&#8217;s money once the limited number is reached?  Pfft.  Must be a language issue going on here, but damn &#8212; if I&#8217;m gonna pitch something to a foreign market, I hire someone who is a native speaker to write the pitch, lest I end up with all your bases are belong to us.</p>
<p>Hasn&#8217;t been much buzz on this game in &#8230; ever &#8230; except one of the e-thugs who has been going on and on about how great this game will be.  He&#8217;s been wrong before though, like the time he tried to talk people into buying Horizons and had to apologize for six months afterwards.</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t trick me into trying that, but the ones that did haven&#8217;t been the same since.  *twitch*</p>
