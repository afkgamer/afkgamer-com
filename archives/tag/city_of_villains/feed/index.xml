It&#8217;s for sure the same monthly fee, $14.99 for both, as announced yesterday by NCSoft.  Just imagine the bios the Villain people would write for themselves:  I was minding my own business when this dude dressed like a freaking bat drops me into a vat of acid.  Months of cosmetic surgery later, my face has no muscular control or pigmentation.  Ya, I guess you could say I&#8217;m bitter.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my e-mailbox today, (my real life email, not my AFK Gamer mailbox &#8212;  Foton doesn&#8217;t shill for anyone except Foton.):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cityofvillains.com/">City of Villains</a> &#8212; Preorders available from selected retailers (EB Games, Game Stop, CompUSA and Best Buy).  Includes:  beta access, two-day head-start before it ships to the public (you know you want that, you gaming whore!), an exclusive in-game item (any chance that won&#8217;t suck?), some limited edition poster, 14-day free trial of City of Heroes for you and one of your imaginary friends, and a CD-ROM with art and shit. </p>
<p>I checked the Game Stop link (Hail, click through!), preorder is 50 bucks with an ETA of October 31, 2005.</p>
<p>So, we have that going for us.  Which is nice.</p>
<p>Also, the somewhat anticipated <a href="http://www.ddo.com/index.php?page_id=66&#038;pagebuilder[module]=article&#038;pagebuilder[display_item]=84">Dungeons &#038; Dragons Online sent out alpha invites</a> recently, with promises of additional invites in the (near?) future.  (Found on <a href="http://www.betawatcher.com/index.aspx">Betawatcher</a>.  FFS, I don&#8217;t start camping a game website until closed beta approaches.)</p>
<p>Turbine SAYS the DDO <a href="http://www.ddo.com/index.php?page_id=63">ETA is the second half of 2005</a>, which, to me, means &#8230; they need to get that bitch out in time for Christmas.</p>
<p>Meh.  I don&#8217;t even know if I&#8217;ll bother with either.  </p>
<p>(You don&#8217;t believe that shit, do you?  You KNOW I&#8217;ll try them both like the gaming whore I am.)</p>
