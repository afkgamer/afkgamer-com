								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>La la la, it&#8217;s good to be a rogue.</p>
<p>Since this is all over the World of Warcraft boards and the (mostly-boring) game video sites, take a look (or just read) about <del datetime="2008-02-20T01:07:24+00:00"><a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=4665324264&#038;sid=1">rogue chest farming in The Underbog</a></del>.  In addition to the linked video in that thread, there&#8217;s several other instructional Underbog videos on WarcraftMovies.  </p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>  Thread deleted under mysterious circumstances (woooOOoooOOooo), but here&#8217;s the gist &#8212; rogue sets Underbog to heroic, stealths into instance, checks upstairs for a chest in 1st position, stealths upstairs to the overhang above the chest, pulls chest-guarding mobs with a long-range aggro mechanism (engineering items, magic candles, etc.), watches now-aggro mobs path around to his position in the distance for max lock-pick time just in case, drop down, vanish to lose aggro, the race to loot the chest is on, loot chest, dance if you&#8217;re a troll rogue, stealth, flee!, PROFIT!  A video link is below for interested rogues.  Shame they deleted that thread.  Most of the entertainment was the rogues calling each other snitching shits and greedy F&#8217;s.  Thanks to DSJ for the heads-up on the thread delete.</p>
<p>(No, my rogue hasn&#8217;t done the Underbog chest thing.  I&#8217;m too busy farming magic candles in Elwynn Forest.)</p>
<p>Speaking of nerfed treasure chests &#8230; and I&#8217;m using the word &#8220;treasure&#8221; loosely &#8230; has anyone ever pulled good loot from an outdoors Outland chest?  I never have.  Never, never, never, never.  I don&#8217;t even know why I bother anymore.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve looted anything worthwhile from an outdoors chest since early 2006, and trust me, I check every one I see.</p>
<p>Chests used to mean something in this game.  Now it&#8217;s just a bunch of crap food not even fit for a hunter pet.</p>
