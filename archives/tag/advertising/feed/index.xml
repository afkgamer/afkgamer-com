								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The latest in the marketing campaigns by World of Warcraft for others, the upcoming movie, Beowulf:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are happy to announce our latest contest, Legendary Tales, inspired by the upcoming Paramount Pictures movie Beowulf. In the style of a graphic novel, tell us your story of overcoming a seemingly insurmountable foe in World of Warcraft. Simply create and submit a screenshot-based photo journal of your in-game exploits, and you could win! Whether you held off the fel orcs of Hellfire Citadel or overcame the chicken scourge of Goldshire, your story should dazzle and amaze.</p>
<p>Five winners will be chosen to receive a one-year subscription to World of Warcraft!</p></blockquote>
<p>(<a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/contests/beowulf/">WoW page for submissions and other details</a>.)</p>
<p>Which sounds lovely, but I doubt very much that this contest was &#8220;inspired&#8221; by Beowulf, but rather was *paid* by Beowulf.  There is a difference. </p>
<p>And I think it would be nice if we just called it like it is instead of pretending the Blizz dudes were &#8220;inspired&#8221; to create a Beowulf-like contest because it seems like a really cool movie.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WoWHead, the pretty, shiny World of Warcraft item database, has been sold to the ZAM Network for over (an estimated, rumored) $1 million.  WoWHead&#8217;s announcement is <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?wowhead-exciting-news">here</a>, along with the now-typical rationalization for selling to former/current/speculated/who-knows-what associates of IGE, gold sellers to the stars. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I say:  why rationalize?  It&#8217;s none of our business, frankly.</p>
<p>An interesting history lesson about this and prior fan site sales, including Thottbot and Allaka-adver-popups, by Ahmed Farooq, former acquisitions dude at IGE:  <a href="http://www.techsoapbox.com/hot-off-the-presses-wowhead-sold-for-over-1-million/">&#8220;Hot off the Presses: Wowhead sold for over $1 million&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>Goddammit, when is somebody going to go on the record with these stories?  The truth is, I can&#8217;t figure out WHAT we&#8217;ve got and until then, I have to use lots of slashed up phrases for all the &#8220;either-or&#8217;s&#8221; like estimated/rumored/speculated and current/former/not-yet-denied.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A humorous game mail I received recently in Lord of the Rings Online:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afkgamer/547989726/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1440/547989726_4e3abb8721.jpg" width="500" height="284" alt="Not My Fault That I'm Game-Poor" class="center" /></a></p>
<p>I could be misreading this but that sounds like a call to REVOLUTION!  Hang the rich.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a screenshot from a recent, wretched Fornost <acronym title="for the last time, Pick! Up! Group!">PUG</acronym>gie to whack the hilt mobs.  As gaming vets, it&#8217;s always our responsibility to get the new-to-gaming noobs up to speed on how all this works.  I realize that, I accept that, but after giving my short-speech about the do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts of crowd control to the same 5 people again and again, I get a little irritated.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afkgamer/547989738/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1422/547989738_3ea42339eb.jpg" width="500" height="38" alt="Crowd Control is for Noobs" class="center" /></a></p>
<p>They never did get it, but fortunately for me, we one-shot the last hilt mob &#8212; a <acronym title="Bad Ass Mo Fo">BAMF</acronym> nemesis mob &#8212; and thank you, Jesus, I never have to go to that pisspool again.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re thirsty for more arrogance and Napoleon-esque posturing, Psycho E-Bitch&#8217;s Fraxx was granted an IM audience with me last week to chat about gaming, books and <del datetime="2007-06-14T14:51:33+00:00">cyber</del> music:  <a href="http://psychoebitch.blogspot.com/2007/06/visit-with-afkgamers-blogging-bad-boy.html">A Visit with AFKGamer&#8217;s Blogging Bad Boy</a>. </p>
<p>Some highlights:  the &#8220;Mithaniel Marr story&#8221;, the rest of you suck, the liberal manifestos I&#8217;m reading, and, gaming&#8217;s last dirty little secret.</p>

<p>How can you have any pudding if you don&#8217;t eat your <del datetime="2007-02-05T06:44:48+00:00">meat</del> fish?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re shopping around for a World of Warcraft gift for your faux WoW girlfriend, you might want to farm <a href="http://www.thottbot.com/?i=54246">A Steamy Romance Novel</a>.</p>

<p><span id="more-1370"></span>It starts off strong, but becomes rather formulaic.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a little disappointed with my fan mag&#8217;s Issue #2.  Page 75 of the online <a href="http://www.afkmagazine.com/">AFK Magazine</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afkgamer/381767391/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/179/381767391_85dfe0677f.jpg" width="418" height="500" alt="Who Are These People" class="center" /></a></p>
<p>Rating every game on a scale of 8.0 &#8211; 10.0 is to be expected, but CMON, L2Edit or disband now.</p>

<p>Many dead noobs and noob NPC guards later, the foul beast fell to the zerg.  The best part of the entertainment, it shut up the trash-talking Goldshire noobs for a good 5 or 10 minutes.  Also taught them an important lesson that will serve them well their entire Warcraft life:  When you see a fire-breathing dragon coming your way, you GET OUT OF THE WAY.</p>
<p>Teremus&#8217; journey from just outside Goldshire to his death in Stormwind is documented in a Flickr photoset, clickable from the thumbnail above.</p>
<p>Lastly, the week is AFK Gamer&#8217;s annual Week of Fives.  Raster (blog slave and guild puppet) and I will be tag-teaming a week of posts looking back on 2006.  Later today, Five Things World of Warcraft Does Really Well.  Ya, really.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Viral marketing evolves further from the primordial mud:  I first saw a thread, similar to <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-realm-moonrunner&#038;t=82352">this one</a>, on my Warcraft realm forums.  The thread is a chatty little bit about a Warcraft dating site, if you&#8217;re too lazy to click.  Let&#8217;s say I saw this on Moonrunner, which I didn&#8217;t because I don&#8217;t play on Moonrunner so don&#8217;t look for me there.  (Repeating:  the answer is NOT Moonrunner.)  Anyways &#8230; thinks me, &#8220;boy, that thread looks like a plant&#8221;, so I checked level 1 gnome <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread-search.aspx?p=1&#038;author=Caseclosed&#038;cluster=wow">Caseclosed&#8217;s post history</a>, suspecting a viral marketer, however, the history looks pretty standard for yer average slack-jawed yokel.  Hmmm.  Searching back to <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread-search.aspx?p=3&#038;author=Caseclosed&#038;cluster=wow">page 3 of his history and earlier</a> &#8230; the viral marketing is unmasked!  (i.e. many, many duplicate posts chatting up the WoW dating site across many, many realms.)  This joker made a bunch of &#8220;bla bla nerf this, buff my class&#8221; posts so that his history would stand up to a casual inspection.  That had to take some effort.  (Furl archives:  <a href="http://www.furl.net/search?search=cache&#038;id=11000266&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.worldofwarcraft.com%2Fthread-search.aspx%3Fp%3D1%26author%3DCaseclosed%26cluster%3Dwow">Post history-page 1</a>, <a href="http://www.furl.net/search?search=cache&#038;id=11000317&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.worldofwarcraft.com%2Fthread-search.aspx%3Fp%3D3%26author%3DCaseclosed%26cluster%3Dwow">Post history-page 3</a>)</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The g-news (I lay copyright claim on that, by the way, but pronounce it gnews, with a silent G, so you don&#8217;t nerd out your coworkers) summarized in five paragraphs:</p>
<p>Schild of f13 caught wind of some Wall Street presentation by Castle Blizzard <del datetime="2006-06-14T12:59:27+00:00">warning of</del> discussing their plans to create MMOGs from all their franchises:  &#8220;All Blizzard franchises will become MMOGs.&#8221;  (<a href="http://www.f13.net/index.php?itemid=167">f13 link reblogged around the world</a>)  No other details are immediately available like, oh &#8230; where on Wall Street this was or to whom was it directed &#8212; I spent five minutes of fruitless googling, that seems plenty.  Hey.  f13 redesigned their site.  Looks good.  </p>
<p>Penny Arcade, the comic lifestyle, has inked some sort of deal with the ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board) for a public service ad campaign targeted at gamers.  From GameDaily BIZ, the purpose of the campaign is to &#8220;&#8230; inform the gaming population why the video game rating system is important to them.&#8221;  (<a href="http://biz.gamedaily.com/industry/adwatch/?id=12943">GDBiz link</a>)  Is it?  I don&#8217;t really think it is.  It&#8217;s important to me the citizen, it&#8217;s important to parents certainly, but me the gamer, it&#8217;s only important so far as I avoid the &#8220;E &#8211; Everyone&#8221; games, like I avoid the &#8220;G &#8211; General Audiences&#8221; movies.  Y&#8217;might think this is exactly why I need to be educated about the benefits of the ESRB, but I think it&#8217;s just a &#8220;W &#8211; Waste of Money&#8221;.</p>
<p>That combat revamp many months ago in Star Wars: Galaxies just might go down in history as the worst business decision ever in gaming &#8212; and I am hopeful because I like to witness history in the making, like I enjoyed being part of the Anarchy Online launch.  Unlike the typical major retool where players become resigned to their new fates and move on with their lives  (usually elsewhere), there&#8217;s a solid core of old school SWGers committed to resurrecting the pre-CU/NGE SWG world.  (<a href="http://www.shardwire.org/News/article/sid=1019.html">ShardWire SWGEmu link:  The First Step into a Larger World</a>)  Sony, there&#8217;s opportunity knocking.  Also, a SWG-classic-ruleset server would eliminate future emails in my inbox from the old SWG gang about getting the pvp guild back together for some wtfpwnage and I would very much appreciate that.  Thanks.</p>
<p><em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, the spam of American offices everywhere, published an article last Friday about <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB114980862872575564-lMyQjAxMDE2NDA5OTgwMDk4Wj.html">gamers that meet in game and get married in real life</a>.  GOD NO!  When did this start happening?!?  (Uhh, back in Ultima Online &#8230; seven years ago.)  You know all that.  What caught my eye were some stats they quoted, courtesy of Nick Yee, game industry voyeur of Stanford University:  29% of women players and 8% of men said they had gone on to date someone they met in a game.  <a href="http://www.edge-online.co.uk/archives/2006/06/love_at_first_b.php">Edge Online</a> and <a href="http://www.we-make-money-not-art.com/archives/008642.php">We Make Money Not Art</a> chased down this additional stat from Yee&#8217;s website:  80% of females and 60% of males have engaged in a little light flirtation [in game].  Holy gender gap.  Age?  Lying?  We&#8217;ve got some real playahs in MMOs who are too busy working the shemales to log out and complete a survey?</p>
<p>Lastly, no patch this week in World of Warcraft.  Still.  It&#8217;s like watching a glacier carve a new landscape &#8212; which makes me think I&#8217;ll be buying that Starcraft MMO for my grandkids, and I haven&#8217;t even started yet.</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t need more players in World of Warcraft.  We need more hardware or different internet hook &#8217;em up thingies or at least some new ideas.  </p>
<p>We, for sure, don&#8217;t need more players who will level a warlock to 60, join a Blackwing Lair raid and then ask if they should <acronym title="free self resurrection">soulstone</acronym> a mage before the fight.  </p>
<p>Ya.  Soulstone a mage please.  Because if the shit starts to hit the proverbial fan, I want to make sure I can get a portal OUT.</p>
<p>I used to wonder where we found some of our fine warlocks, but now I know:  It must have been a past Recruit A Friend drive.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[EndLagNow.org is a community of gamers and &#8230; I think only gamers so far &#8230; who are taking a stand against lag in online gaming, which seems really similar to being against war, drug abuse and mean people, like duh. &#8230; <a href="https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/archives/2006/04/24/so-lag-is-bad-then/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.endlagnow.org/ELN/">EndLagNow.org</a> is a community of gamers and &#8230; I think only gamers so far &#8230; who are taking a stand against lag in online gaming, which seems really similar to being against war, drug abuse and mean people, like duh.  I&#8217;m not super knowledgable about internet technology and how the ping gets from Point A to Point B, but I think that lag is inevitable unless I&#8217;m trapped inside the game in which case I have a larger problem than lag, namely zombies and giant wildlife.  Hey, here&#8217;s a weird coincidence:  the website&#8217;s sponsor announced a new super secret technology to reduce lag, so they&#8217;re not just jabbering about lag, they&#8217;re trying to combat gaming lag, the first step of which appears to be setting up phony protests and communities.</p>
