								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The &#8220;Great Warlock Life Tap Nerf of 2008&#8221;, another one of those &#8220;We&#8217;re Totally Not Balancing World of Warcraft Around PVP And Especially Not Arenas, But We Are&#8221; adjustments, has finally made it to the Test Realm Patch Notes which puts it one step closer to reality on the live servers.  </p>
<blockquote><p>Life Tap: This spell now has only 3 ranks. Each now costs a fixed percentage of maximum health to cast, and grants the same fixed percentage of maximum mana: Rank 1 is 5%, Rank 2 is 12%, and Rank 3 is 20%.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you don&#8217;t pay attention to warlocks other than to curse at or about them, this is huge.  Currently, Life Tap converts a fixed quantity of health into mana (e.g. 580 health lifetaps into 580 mana), ergo, warlocks have geared heavily for high hitpoints (+ stamina gear and enchants, donchaknow) and mana pools be damned, they just swap their health into mana and eat babies&#8217; souls.  Indeed, even their class armor reflects this fascination with stamina over intellect and mana regeneration &#8212; cuz what care they for regen, lifetap isn&#8217;t at the mercy of out-of-combat mana rules or potion cooldowns.</p>
<p>It WAS what made warlocks so very deadly, and, so very valuable to raid DPS.</p>
<p>Of course.  If that nerf goes live.  Not so much.  At least for a while until the &#8216;locks can regear for intellect over stamina.  ENJOY!!  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s like a minigame within the game, just like bag space.  Regear for this, regear for that, resist sets are nice too, plus carry all that around in your tiny backpacks of suck.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve been watching the warlock venom on the Test Realm forums as Blizzard has cycled through multiple adjustments to the nerf because the &#8216;locks, they be LIVID, and the other classes are enjoying the show, and really &#8230; you should not relish another class&#8217; nerf.  The Wheel of Nerfs: round and round she goes, where she&#8217;ll stop, nobody knows.</p>
<p>Witness:  Forum thread &#8211; <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=5103802860&#038;sid=1">LOCKS DESERVE EVERY SINGLE NERF THEY GET</a> by Naitsirhc, level 64 shadow priest, suspected mage alt, of the Eldre&#8217;Thalas realm.</p>
<blockquote><p>Any class that can drain life and mana is insanely OP, and you guys know it. It was not your fault that this game mechanic continues to exist, but I think every single nerf is warranted and should be applied to BALANCE this crap. And yes I am talking about PvP, I can care less about PvE. I&#8217;m sorry to be blunt, but this has gone on for far too freakin long.</p></blockquote>
<p>The accusation:  Reply #2 by Thromgal, level 70 warlock of Kil&#8217;jaeden.</p>
<blockquote><p>You can go ahead and post on your mage.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which sums up that thread very nicely.</p>
<p>And speaking of a mass exodus, where have all the healers gone??  Long time passing.  Long time ago.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s rhetorical, I know very well where the healers have gone &#8212; away.</p>
<p>I did some faux research on the Healer Exodus of my own WoW realm by reading through all the recruitment threads on the first page &#8212; these would be all the recruitment threads that have been /bumped in the last few days, i.e. active recruitment threads.</p>
<p>The Results of my ten-minute research project:</p>
<p><strong>Alliance</strong><br />
10 total recruitment threads<br />
8 seeking healers only, 1 seeking healers + DPS<br />
1 seeking DPS only (lucky dogs)</p>
<p><strong>Horde</strong><br />
5 total recruitment threads<br />
1 seeking healers + DPS<br />
4 seeking DPS only (also lucky)</p>
<p>Some interesting faux facts from my own guild:</p>
<p>Of our raid healing core, only 2 are pre-Burning Crusade healing mains &#8212; 1 paladin, 1 priest.  A week ago, the count would have been 3 &#8212; 2 paladins + that one very dedicated priest, but the one paladin &#8230; you might remember him as our <a href="https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/archives/2007/10/03/the-whatever-that-happened-to-that-one-girl/">paladin man-whore</a> &#8230; he left our guild last week.  </p>
<p>Quick drama debriefing:  Our paladin man-whore left because his latest imaginary game girlfriend abandoned him and started hanging with our other pre-BC paladin (also a man-whore as we discovered), which drove the first man-whore into another emo phase for a few weeks, then he decided &#8220;fuck this&#8221; and left.  Probably to seek other imaginary game girlfriends, who knows.  Anyways, this relationship with ManWhore02 and the aforementioned imaginary game girlfriend is really distracting because they are usually fighting, and she&#8217;s usually threatening to LEAVE THE SERVER and what do we care if she leaves, she&#8217;s not a healer, then ManWhore02 gets upset with the guildmates cuz goddamit we should care but I just want to /gkick the both of them and be done with it.  And further, it&#8217;s this kind of shit which tempts me to call for a moratorium on guilding female players, my apologies to all the drama-averse female players out there, but can&#8217;t people keep their personal lives out of the game and just kill stuff?  Crimony!</p>
<p>Anyhow.  Except for those two pre-BC healers, the rest of the raid healing core are post-BC healers.  I&#8217;m hoping they have at least a few months in them before they burn out too.</p>
<p>Ya, I have a lot of hope.  I don&#8217;t have any resto shaman, but I have a whole lot of hope.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rarely am I organized enough to bookmark game issues so I can check back later and see &#8220;whatever happened to that promised fix?&#8221;  Oh &#8230; like, say, the World of Warcraft Global Cooldown changes back in November 2007.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2969689888&#038;pageNo=7&#038;sid=1#123">here was the promise</a>, as writ by Drysc, dripping tree of Blizzard:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re continuing to read reports and feedback, and we&#8217;ve recently applied a hotfix that should make it easier to chain cast spells without seeing the &#8220;Another action is in progress&#8221; or &#8220;Spell is not ready yet&#8221; messages at the end of casting.</p>
<p>That was just part of the fix; the other part has to be addressed client-side and requires a patch.</p>
<p>The fix that&#8217;s in the patch is to address players getting the &#8220;Spell is not ready yet&#8221; when spamming at the beginning of a cast. This message happens instead of just seeing a &#8220;quick click&#8221;  of the spell, which doesn&#8217;t affect DPS, but certainly changes the feel of playing as if something has gone wrong. The patch with this other part of the fix will be available on the PTRs within the next week.</p>
<p>We really want everyone to get on the PTR when it does go live, test the changes, and report their findings on the Test Realm forum. We&#8217;re continuing to read reports, test the issue internally, and want to reach a resolution that addresses the concerns.</p></blockquote>
<p>And indeed, the fix is now on the Public Test Realm.  It&#8217;s called Spell Haste.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whilst I was marveling at the warlock ner &#8230; changes as proposed on the World of Warcraft Public Test Realm, aka Patch 2.4 &#8220;We Hate You All, but not you rogues because you have so little in this life it would be cruel to take anything away&#8221;, I found this nerd rage thread on the WoW PTR forums:  <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=4665320727&#038;sid=1&#038;pageNo=1">To Casuals on a Silver Platter</a>.</p>
<p>I love that thread because there&#8217;s a handful of hardcores dueling dozens of casuals &#8212; and isn&#8217;t that what the Hardcore vs Casual argument is really about?  A numbers game, ultimately a profit equation, and in that system Casuals &gt; Hardcore.  You live, you learn.</p>
<p>So, hardcore player Altyera of the Dalaran realm, self-described as &#8220;&#8230; better at this game than you. Much, much, much better&#8221;, wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Powerful rewards for people incapable of playing this game seriously? Fine.</p>
<p>Give me something for playing this game well. Give me something for investing three and a half years playing my chosen class to the fullest. Give me something for organizing twenty-five people every week into a well-oiled machine capable of flawlessly tackling complex encounters. Give my members something special for beating the game.</p>
<p>Give me a title for killing every boss in the game. Make my name sparkle and the ground glow at my feet.</p>
<p>Give me a 310% mount for killing Illidan. It&#8217;s no less an accomplishment than Gladiator.</p>
<p>Give me an entire array of legendary weapons dropping from Illidan, Archimonde and Kil&#8217;jaeden. What casual could complain that they&#8217;re not well-earned?</p>
<p>Give me and the top 500 guilds a private forum to converse directly with the developers.</p>
<p>Give me early access to private test realms, expedited character copies and a direct line to the developers while I&#8217;m testing content.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re giving an awful lot to casual players in this patch. Give me back as much as I put into this game. Great, fun stuff for casuals is awesome, and it&#8217;s one reason WoW is so popular. Give the top 1% some incentive to continue investing the time and effort necessary to stay at the top of this game.</p>
<p>Gear that is 3% better than a casual player&#8217;s and a couple fancy titles for doing things that no longer matter are far, far less than we deserve. </p></blockquote>
<p>This is what I love about the Hardcore vs Casual debate as the Hardcores frequently argue:  it&#8217;s not enough that Casuals get less, or later, than the Hardcores, they have to get much less, preferably much later.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some more:</p>
<p>Reply #60</p>
<blockquote><p>The people who consider themselves casuals ruin the game for the people that play it with the purpose of trying to accomplish something they consider great. They spoil the rewards earned by people who put the time, effort, and thought into raiding. </p></blockquote>
<p>HAHAHA.  You casuals are RUINING the game for the people who accomplish GREAT things.  Oh fercrissakes.</p>
<p>Reply #13</p>
<blockquote><p>I have seen people with families and careers get to illidan and farm BT&#8230;.nobody has an excuses anymore except lack of trying and just plain giving up or being a paraplegic, down-syndrome monkey. Why should they be entitled to free stuff for not trying when the people that actually try get exactly the same things? Its beyond silly&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Parapalegics don&#8217;t deserve epics either, I guess.  Nice attitude, asshole.</p>
<p>Reply #26</p>
<blockquote><p>Oh wait, I forgot that most casuals are god-awful at this game.</p></blockquote>
<p>Pssst, so are most hardcores.</p>
<p>Reply #37</p>
<blockquote><p>You just can&#8217;t talk to them Alty, they refuse, can&#8217;t, and never will understand anything about risk/reward in the game, or life.</p></blockquote>
<p>He&#8217;s probably one of those gamers who are CEO of their own start-ups pulling down six figures while married to the super-model wife and raising six children.  Even on my own WoW server, we have a lot of those.  I assume they&#8217;re passing out WoW boxes with subscriptions to Fortune and The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>Reply #139</p>
<blockquote><p>Raiders and hard-core pvper&#8217;s make-up the core and soul of this game. Kill that and kill the game. All you are doing is catering to make sh1t so damn easy my unborn child could clear every instance in the game within a week. I&#8217;m wondering when they will be giving away epics upon creating an account. </p></blockquote>
<p>Hyperbole can be an effective argument tool.  This would not be a good example of such.</p>
<p>Every EverQuest and Ultima Online player remembers a day when there was no choice like we have in WoW now.  I didn&#8217;t play UO, but I did play EQ and there was no casual play &#8212; everything required a guild, and an able guild at that.  (Ok, there was roleplaying and cyber, but we&#8217;re talking about gear and character advancement here, stud.)  That wasn&#8217;t good.</p>
<p>Sure it was great killing Nagafen with 60 people, or getting your class epic (thanks to your guild, and possibly the entire server), but it would have been nice to have another option to get stuff.  The stuff didn&#8217;t have to be the best, just better than the stuff we had.  Choice would have been nice.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s raiders do deserve better rewards, yes &#8212; they put in more time and deal with headaches that a solo player will never know &#8212; but we should not argue for a big gear gap.  Never, never, never should we argue for a big gear gap.  </p>
<p>One reason:  recruitment.</p>
<p><span id="more-1609"></span>There are two pools for raiding guilds to recruit from (yes, hardcore ones also):  other guilds and new(er)-to-raiding players.  If you&#8217;re a bottom-line type person, think of this as Good Gear and Shit Gear.  If you&#8217;re delusional, you might think of it as Skilled Players vs Clueless Noobs.  </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re pulling most of your new guildmates from other guilds, you&#8217;re recruiting guild hoppers, loot whiners, the &#8220;I have to log after that last wipe for real life stuff but really I&#8217;m tired of wiping and will rejoin you when this is on farm&#8221; opportunists, plus a few valuable guildmates along the way.  </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re refreshing your ranks with new(er)-to-raiding characters, you may similarly be plagued.  Players slow to learn, prone to log mid-raid, incapable of moving out of dangerous floor bombs, ignorant of class abilities and/or strengths and weaknesses, also guild hoppers and loot whiners, plus &#8230; a few valuable guildmates along the way &#8230; BUT your guild has to gear and attune them as well.</p>
<p>YAY!!! Back-gearing and back-attuning is fun!!  </p>
<p>I assume all the hardcore guilds have the same goal:  forward.  Probably all guilds, hard and soft, have that same objective, in fact.  Back-anything is not forward, by definition, and is to be avoided or mitigated at all costs.</p>
<p><strong>For the TLDR crowd:</strong>  Many hardcores overestimate their skill, contributions and the value of their game accomplishments.</p>
<p>Many casuals overestimate how interesting their real lives are.</p>
<p>Raid zones should have better rewards than solo content, otherwise why raid?  </p>
<p>The gap between raid gear and solo/small group/small raid gear should not be so large as to require a long time commitment to get newer raiders ready for current guild targets.</p>
<p>Rogues should never be nerfed because we have so little in this world (of warcraft).</p>

(<a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Tom_Chilton/%22Kalganism%22_Controversy">Here&#8217;s the WoWWiki page</a> &#8212; and more links! &#8212; with the history of the forum term &#8220;Kalganism&#8221;.  Definition, briefly:  to be nerfed in order to favor Kalgan&#8217;s latest PVP character, usually his warrior.)</p>
<p>Nevermind that I know about 234,509 warriors who would disagree that other classes have been nerfed to favor their PVP performance, what&#8217;s relevant to this discussion is today&#8217;s hate.  </p>
<p>Some <strong>additional</strong> class changes for Patch 2.4 were announced today, principally <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=4665464674&#038;sid=1">nerfing to elemental shaman</a>.  <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=4665535766&#038;sid=1">And priests</a>.  (And rogues?  Whew, the rogue beating doesn&#8217;t appear fatal.  Again!  HA HA HA!) </p>
<p>Now here&#8217;s the big accusation:  <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=4665565668&#038;sid=1&#038;pageNo=1">Must Read If You Care About Anything .. Ever</a>.  <del datetime="2008-02-20T22:14:34+00:00">And I fully expect that thread to die a mysterious death, but I&#8217;m prepared this time!</del>  (Thread died while I was typing.  What a shock.  Links to the screenshots are at the end.)</p>
<p>Anyways, posting alt Jayne of the Akama realm wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>This isn&#8217;t a troll, and is entirely true.</p>
<p>1) There is a non-blue player named &#8220;Leiah&#8221; who regularly posts on the warlock forms about upcoming patch changes, sometimes as much as months in advance.</p>
<p>2) Leiah was formerly an arena partner with Kalgan&#8217;s (the developer) warrior, as well as a member of the same guild. He has acknowledged this in the past, and it is generally well-known.</p>
<p>3) Leiah has claimed to have influenced design decisions as a result of his banter and feedback with the developer &#8212; most notably he suggested in mid-January that elemental shamans had too much burst damage, and that, as Leiah put it, &#8220;Kalgan sees it my way&#8221;, and that a mechanic change was upcomming.</p>
<p>4) Leiah is now bragging on the warlock forums about how the changes he demanded have been implemented on the PTR &#8212; and he is entirely correct. The suggestions he made were implemented almost exactly the way he said that he wanted them done over a month ago. This was long before leaked patch notes or any sort of official Blizzard communication.</p>
<p>This is not a blizzard developer making decisions based on hard knowledge or numbers. This is just a friend of a developer who has an inside ear, and is producing results based solely on his limited player experiences.</p>
<p>What is upsetting is that he is allowed to then disseminate this information on the forums as childish bragging and gloating. The shaman community learned about their major 2.4 nerfs from some random guy telling them to &#8220;QQ&#8221; on the warlock forums&#8230; only to have it proven totally true a month later.</p>
<p>So the next time you are wondering if Blizzard really hates your class, or just who in the hell is calling the shots, look no further than some chums of the developers who got bested by your class/spec a few times and complained about it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then fanbois and haters alike climb aboard for the flame train and we&#8217;re off!</p>
<p>Normally, I&#8217;d also dismiss this as fantasy, but I&#8217;m gonna guess what&#8217;s really going on here is some nobody (Leiah in our example) thinks he&#8217;s/she&#8217;s somebody when he/she posts about the casual conversations he/she has had with the Kalganator while doing arenas.  Obviously, this is a big no-no to players and SHOULD BE to the gaming companies, and probably is to most, but there is a history around here of employees getting (too?) cozy with their guilds and their gaming mates.</p>
<p>However.  It could be as simple as how my arenas and battlegrounds go.</p>
<p>Me:  I really hate blood elf paladins.<br />
Partner:  Ya, me too.  Blood elf anything.<br />
Me:  You&#8217;re not hearing me.  I REALLY fucking hate blood elf paladins.  I want them DEAD! I want their families DEAD! I want their houses burned to the ground!</p>
<p>And if I was a dev-head, and my partner was an IDIOT and posted that BELF paladins were about to take it in the rear, then tada!  BELF paladins take it in the rear, that would look pretty bad.  Y&#8217;see that&#8217;s the thing with non-disclosure type jobs:  you have to keep your hands clean, <strong>and</strong> your hands have to look clean too.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I wonder &#8230; why has this boasting and nerf-threatening been going on for months?  Allegedly.  </p>
<p>And I wonder this too:  why in God&#8217;s name would a higher-level dev name his game character the same as his forum persona?  Please tell me they don&#8217;t because that&#8217;s stupid.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know Kalgan and his posts well enough to hate him like some of the WoW players, but I tell you this &#8230; if he&#8217;s in charge of bag space, he&#8217;s on my list.  The same list as BELF paladins.</p>

<a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=4665326036&#038;sid=1">Kalgan responds to the totem droppers</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Shamans in general will be getting buffs to go along with their nerfs. Bear in mind that there&#8217;s still quite a bit that hasn&#8217;t been implemented yet.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d share some of these with you, but some of them might not be technically do-able for this patch, which in turn changes some of our decisions about exactly what changes we make, so we&#8217;re hesitant to give specifics until the work has been done.</p>
<p>Philosophically though, we&#8217;re planning to make a number of improvements related to the totem dropping mechanic, improving specific under-used totems, and a few other non-totem related improvements.</p>
<p>To provide a little bacground, our general outlook on the class is that they&#8217;re actually in good shape for all 3 specs for raid PvE, on the weak side for heroic PvE, pretty solid in battlegrounds and 5v5, on the weak side in 3v3, and pretty well gimped in 2v2. We&#8217;re hoping to get at least 1 spec viable in 2v2 for this patch (we&#8217;re thinking Enhance), but hopefully all three specs will be viable for 3v3.</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s the quick version of what I&#8217;ve been up to the past month, besides taking some time off to sharpen my axe:</p>
<p>1.  Holidays.  Duh.<br />
2.  Traveling for the holidays.<br />
3.  Finished a major project at work.  Ka-ching!<br />
4.  Traveling for work.  Bleh.<br />
5.  Updated the blog software and ruined the site &#8230; on New Year&#8217;s Day while VERY hung over.  That was fun.<br />
6.  Told 1/3 of our World of Warcraft guild membership to GTFO of our guild.  We realized it was more efficient to have them type /gquit then go down the list and /gkick.  Really saved a lot of time.<br />
7.  Explained on Vent that we really did mean it.<br />
8.  No.  Seriously.  GTFO.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing.  Every goddamn year around Christmas time, raiding guilds go through this period where people are traveling or spending time with their families or both, cuz THAT&#8217;S WHAT NORMAL PEOPLE DO.  So, of course, the raiding (read:  the loot train) slows down or grinds to a halt, only to pick up again after the holidays have passed.  And every goddamn year, there&#8217;s a group of players who begin to panic when the loot train isn&#8217;t chugging down the tracks.  &#8220;Are we disbanding?&#8221;  &#8220;Will we raid again?&#8221;  &#8220;This guild is dead!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Fercrissakes, it&#8217;s two weeks out of the year and these losers can&#8217;t wait for people to get back to their computers.  </p>
<p>So our officers told the losers not to panic, and, after the holidays, they&#8217;d see, everything would be back to normal.</p>
<p>Apparently, losers don&#8217;t have access to calendars, and in their world, the holidays are over December 26th.  Therefore, they had been more than patient by waiting until January 1st to start issuing ultimatums like &#8230; replacing our long-serving officers and giving King Loser the guildleader rank.  (Riiight.)</p>
<p>See #5 above.  I was trying to put out a fire on Ye Olde Blog while alt-tabbed at the PVP lounge and those sonuvabitches are complaining because we&#8217;re not in Serpentshrine Cavern and goddammit, turn over that guildleader tag and give them admin rights to all the web resources and the Ventrilo server so they can get to it.  </p>
<p>The officers said, &#8220;So go raid SSC, nothing stopping you.&#8221;  And indeed, they were welcome to raid SSC, there was nothing stopping them.  </p>
<p>Not good enough.  They wanted the raid leader to stop playing his alt and lead the raid; they wanted me to stop screwing around at the PVP battlemasters and heal the raid on my priest alt; and pretty much everyone to stop what they&#8217;re doing for a good old-fashioned New Year&#8217;s Day raid in Serpentshrine Cavern.</p>
<p>It was one of those super-rare moments when everyone&#8217;s temper blows at once.  In short, every single officer online issued a &#8220;GTFO&#8221; (or some variation thereof), and me, late to the party, added my GTFO on Ventrilo &#8230; y&#8217;know, for the illiterate in the audience.</p>
<p>Those that GTFO are now on their third post-Foton guild.  </p>
<p><span id="more-1597"></span>9.  Remember that one chick in my guild who plays the same class as me, and, she and her imaginary guild boyfriend always hassled me &#8212; more accurately, <a href="https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/archives/2007/07/28/where-in-the-wow-23/">passively aggressively hassled me</a> &#8212; about rolling/bidding on any loot ever that she might want?  They left.  Server transferred to another server where her dude had a real life friend in a Black Temple guild.  He&#8217;s the one guy in all of gaming who has a worse personality online than out in the world.  We were all (secretly) glad to see them leave.  </p>
<p>Guess that didn&#8217;t work out though because they&#8217;re unguilded now.  BIG surprise.</p>
<p>10.  I PVP&#8217;d <strong>ALOT</strong>.  Mostly Eye of the Storm.  As you might recall, <a href="https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/archives/2007/12/11/lets-swap/">Alterac Valley is dead</a> on my battlegroup, but I tried AV out a few times to see if it was still dead.  Take a look.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afkgamer/2260572528/" title="Zero Bonus Honor is Fun by AFK Gamer, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2237/2260572528_35eacf0e18.jpg" width="500" height="287" alt="Zero Bonus Honor is Fun" class="center" /></a></p>
<p>This one was outrageous too:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afkgamer/2260575072/" title="Still Zero by AFK Gamer, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2120/2260575072_79dc19ec71.jpg" width="500" height="287" alt="Still Zero" class="center" /></a></p>
<p>A screenshot demonstrating the sieve-like qualities of the Stormpike graveyard: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afkgamer/2260574984/" title="Stormpike the Sieve by AFK Gamer, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2098/2260574984_dee261c8c8.jpg" width="500" height="313" alt="Stormpike the Sieve" class="center" /></a></p>
<p>That was actually a fun Alterac Valley.  No wait.  It wasn&#8217;t.  Made a good screenshot tho.</p>
<p>11.  Leveled up a couple of alts, mostly for PVP fun, and took them to Alterac Valley to see if the other brackets are as stupid as the level 70 AV.  Surprisingly, no.  And I&#8217;ll say here, if your battlegroup&#8217;s Horde aren&#8217;t winning every single AV except late at night when they all fall asleep at the keyboard, your Horde aren&#8217;t doing it right.<br />
12.  Chuckled at the AV changes coming in Patch 2.4.  Whatever.  It&#8217;s much too late.  Patch 2.3 was released 11/13/2007 so that&#8217;s 3 months (and counting) of Horde 3 medals plus 500-ish+ bonus honor per versus Alliance one medal + 0-ish bonus honor per.  On my battlegroup at least &#8230; and almost all the others now.  No way that gear gap will have a lasting effect.  No way.<br />
13.  Shelved my level 70 priest alt, probably for good, but at least until Wrath of the Lich King&#8217;s gear reset.  And I mean SHELVED.  Emptied the mailbox, burned the transmute timers, shipped out the gold and primo mats to my rogue, and wrote a short retirement post for the guild boards.  And I&#8217;ll tell you the reasons why.  </p>
<p>As healers burnt out, we were relying more and more on my priest to pick up the healing slack, which was the purpose of my priest alt, yes, but I figure I&#8217;ve put in my time and we were never going to stop leaning on my priest until I called a halt to it.  So I did.</p>
<p>But also, I confirmed in my own mind what I suspected when The Burning Crusade went live:  priests are not the foundation on which to build a guild&#8217;s healing strategy anymore.  I&#8217;ll go so far as to say that guilds should bring ONE priest on raids for the buffs, shadow-spec preferred, and round out the raid healing with paladins primarily + druids and shaman.</p>
<p>You might disagree, many in my guild do.  </p>
<p>(And NO!  I do NOT want Blizzard to nerf paladins &#8230; or druids or shaman.  Toss the priests a bone and stop yammering about Lightwell, you twits.)</p>
<p>14.  Attracted another anonymous game stalker who hates me and my guild and can&#8217;t stop posting about his hate on the official World of Warcraft boards from the safety of his level-nothing posting alt.</p>
<p>I promise you this:  I am going to find out who that motherfucker is and then I&#8217;m going to call him on his bullshit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his drama posts are becoming ever more shrill since we (the royal guild we) all refuse to take his bait.</p>
<p>15.  Did some thinking about server transferring.  My realm is low/medium population, guild recruitment is a bitch lemmetellya, and as you know, my battlegroup is awful.  It&#8217;s not just the AV thing, our Alliance has some truly terrible PVPers &#8212; disheartened PVPers, always-AFK PVPers, and stupid, very very stoopid PVPers, hunters who never trap, warlocks who never fear, paladins who think they have Hammers of Glory, rogues who can&#8217;t afford poisons, the list is endless.  Sad.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it&#8217;s a great realm for leveling alts or farming mat(erial)s.</p>
<p>Still thinking on that, but if you have a realm recommendation, by all means, speak up.</p>
<p>16.  STILL haven&#8217;t received a Warhammer Online beta invite.  Those bastards.<br />
17.  Holy crap, that was a lot of spam email, phishing and keyloggers!<br />
18.  Realized that procrastinating blogly administrative chores for a month isn&#8217;t such a great idea.  I mean, why can&#8217;t the internet tend to itself for a few weeks?  I don&#8217;t know.  It just won&#8217;t.<br />
19.  Our guild <a href="https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/archives/2007/10/03/the-whatever-that-happened-to-that-one-girl/">paladin man-whore</a> MADE us guild invite his latest game love interest.  She promptly dumped him and took up with another paladin in the guild.  How long until this blows up in our face?  (Y&#8217;know, more so than it already has.)  I&#8217;m going to guess two weeks, tops.</p>
<p>So we all have THAT to look forward to.</p>
<p>and 20.  I discovered a place on the public World of Warcraft forums where no man, woman or child should dare tread:  the battlegroup forums.  </p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve never been, it&#8217;s worse than you can imagine, and if you have been, it&#8217;s worse than you remember.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to recover ever since my gruesome discovery.  That&#8217;s my story and I&#8217;m sticking to it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>World of Warcraft&#8217;s <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2856015159&#038;sid=1">arena season 3 has been delayed another week</a> until November 27, 2007.  Here&#8217;s the pretty language:</p>
<blockquote><p>Everyone is preparing for the start of the third arena season and we&#8217;re excited to get new items, rewards, and fresh competition going for everyone participating in the arenas.</p>
<p>As we approach the previously announced start date we&#8217;ve had growing concerns of what the new season requires of us to actually launch, and its proximity to the Thanksgiving holiday. Everyone wants the launch go as smoothly as possible, and in order to have resources available to tend to any issues as soon as they may spring up, we&#8217;ve decided to delay the Season 3 start date to November 27. One week after the previously announced date.</p>
<p>This allows us to have the quickest response time to any issues should they occur, and allows everyone to enjoy the holiday and the days leading up to it. While making everyone wait another week obviously isn&#8217;t the optimal outcome, in the end we decided it would be much worse to start Season 3 so close to the holiday and potentially make players wait longer until a problem can be resolved. Ultimately it allows us to provide the best possible service for everyone as we launch the new season. </p></blockquote>
<p>Non-gamer types might wonder if there really are people whose holidays would be RUINED by broken game mechanics, but you and I (and the Blizzard Collective) know better, don&#8217;t we?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is what the entrance to Zul&#8217;Aman looks like after the World of Warcraft instance servers crash, burn and are resurrected:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afkgamer/2017021979/" title="Zul'Aman Entrance, post-server crash by AFK Gamer, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2044/2017021979_074bb211bd.jpg" width="500" height="313" alt="Zul'Aman Entrance, post-server crash" class="center" /></a></p>
<p>Very crowded with pissed off players.  </p>
<p>What you can&#8217;t see are all the dead people still running back into the zone to fetch their bodies after logging in.  You also can&#8217;t see the two Alliance guys who were PVP flagged and tried to escape the newly-flagging Horde by running back into Zul&#8217;Aman, but failed &#8230; and died &#8230; and we all had a good laugh.  They had even /yelled HEPL!! a few times, which made their predicament all the more hilarious.</p>
<p>So, Patch 2.3 went live yesterday, and is <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2856224331&#038;sid=1">scheduled for a hotfix</a> this morning.  No doubt they&#8217;re fixing that <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2856203986&#038;sid=1">little shaman problem</a> &#8230; y&#8217;know, where shaman Tier 6 armor was free.

<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re aware that the Shaman Tier 6 restoration set currently does not have a cost requirement on it and we&#8217;re working to resolve this as soon as possible.</p>
<p>We will be going to great lengths to remove the items already purchased, and tracking them down if they&#8217;ve been moved or converted in any way. Do not enchant or socket a gem into the items as they will be deleted when the item is.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hopefully, they&#8217;ll squash a few more bugs along the way.</p>
<p>In addition to all the threads about the changes to Global Cooldown, Alterac Valley, guild bank startup costs, and etc., I found this nutball&#8217;s forum announcement that he intends to level 9 characters, one of each class, to level 70 before the release of the next expansion:  <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2766079972&#038;sid=1">1 through 70, 9 Times before WOTLK!</a>  His characters, as of a few days ago, were all in their early to late 20s, so &#8230; he&#8217;s got a ways to go.</p>
<p>As crazy as that is, come to find out, there&#8217;s other crazy people with similar crazy ideas.  Like Reply #118 on page 6, by Strongboar of the Dunemaul server:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m doing kinda the same thing currently I have 7 characters I play 1 of them a day then move on to the next. I have 4 horde and 3 alliance on 2 different pvp servers to switch it up a bit. In the past I&#8217;ve tried this and I rushed into it way to quickly and burned myself out so I&#8217;ve parental controlled my time on my account to try to prevent from losing interest in this game to quickly.</p></blockquote>
<p>And Adrena of the Fenris realm (Reply #109 on page 6):</p>
<blockquote><p>Each character also has 2 professions (+ cooking on my hunter), and get this.. I&#8217;m going to max fishing on all of them <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p></blockquote>
<p>!!!</p>
<p>(I better not see any of them fishing Blackwind Lake for Mr. Pinchy.)</p>
<p>World of Warcraft comes equipped with so many barriers already, I didn&#8217;t realize that some players would INVENT their own barriers &#8230; for fun.  They probably don&#8217;t even consider them barriers &#8212; I&#8217;ll bet they call them challenges.  </p>
<p>That&#8217;s just nuts.</p>
<p>BONUS:  A forum thread collecting <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2856223600&#038;sid=1&#038;pageNo=1">the undocumented patch changes</a>.  The thread author has some catch up to do on editing the original post, so you&#8217;ll have to read through the later pages for now.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my quest to spoonfeed World of Warcraft patch information and other blue news to my guild, I found two new-to-me websites with customizable WoW news and blues:  <a href="http://wowfix.com/">WoWFix.com</a>, which includes news from fansites and other unofficial sources, and <a href="http://www.wowblues.com/">WoWBlues</a>, a blue-only tracking site.  Both are well done, and, with just a little bit of code wrangling, the RSS feeds can be integrated into your guild&#8217;s website for free automagic content.</p>
<p>And as you can see, I&#8217;ve already coined the phrase &#8220;Blues&#8217; Clues&#8221;, which you may NOT use without my permission, and that would probably require begging and flattery.  Money works too.</p>
<p>UPDATE:  WoWBlues already giving me a clue &#8212; today&#8217;s patching <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2855963379&#038;postId=29493197119&#038;sid=1#10">extended by two hours</a> to 1 pm PST, so sayeth dripping tree Drysc.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This might be of use to you World of Warcraft people, especially if you&#8217;ve been saving up 75,000 honor points and 8,900 badges &#8212; <a href="http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=1629.0#post_aprice">a comprehensive listing</a> of the new equipment, recipes, patterns and gear prices of Tuesday&#8217;s Patch 2.3.   (thread last edited October 19th, so I can&#8217;t vouch for the accuracy.  via MMO Champion&#8217;s forums.) </p>
<p>I&#8217;m guarding Tower Point right now, plus, I&#8217;m making a shopping list for my alt&#8217;s honor points.  I can multi-task like that.</p>
