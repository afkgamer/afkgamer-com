			<p>I&#8217;m not kidding.  I&#8217;m so tired of people and their baggage, I&#8217;d really like to order all my Warcraft guildmates out of the guild and I&#8217;ll just run around collecting flowers and ore and checking my game mail for sales.  &#8220;Fuck all of you, get out.&#8221;  I only hesitate because I know some of them won&#8217;t get out and there we&#8217;ll be, all ten of us, sitting in guildchat, staring at one another.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s back up.  Few weeks ago, there&#8217;s this HUGE drama problem in the guild.  I&#8217;m involved peripherally.  And it&#8217;s big as it involves an officer and real lives and &#8230; let&#8217;s leave it at that.  (Remember, I said I was involved peripherally, so don&#8217;t send emails asking what the hell I fucked up this time.  On the periph, that&#8217;s me.  I was catching fallout though, hence my problem.)</p>
<p>The drama news broke and the guild started creaking at the seams.  The guildleader (aka Puppet #2) asked me what I thought should be done about this little mess to ensure guild tranquility and, after about two minutes consideration, I ordered the assassination of one of the directly involved parties.  (I mean an assassination in the guild sense &#8230; your basic /gkick.)  Instead of accepting their fate gracefully, the newly unguilded started raising a ruckus &#8230; they&#8217;re gonna bring down this guild, there&#8217;ll be nothing but ashes in a few days, we&#8217;ll all be sorry, also, Foton is a prick.  Whatever.  Move along, asshole.</p>
<p>Frankly, it was largely a business equation.  I weighed the guild-worth of the involved players and who could continue to work together amicably, and they were odd man out.  I mean CMON, I&#8217;m not gonna boot a priest, I&#8217;m not an idiot in matters of the guild.</p>
<p>(Repeating a lesson from weeks prior:  Do NOT fuck, or fuck with, the guild priests.  Too much fallout.)</p>
<p>Ok.  That was a few weeks ago and we fast forward to this week &#8230; The guild is recovering nicely from that little mess, although, I&#8217;m still pissed off that we had to deal with all of it.  Bright side, I&#8217;m mighty proud of myself for ordering the assassination and seeing it done before my very eyes.  (Power, she be intoxicating.)</p>
<p>In the midst of all the drama, a tiny sliver of guild powerbrokers was trying to grab some political muscle, with some minor success I will add.  In hindsight, I didn&#8217;t really notice at first because I was occupied with cleanup duty, shoring up the ranks, farming raid loot so everyone&#8217;s getting paid.  Y&#8217;know, doing my game job?  But, live and learn, baby.  Live and learn.</p>
<p>Once order was restored, the powerbrokers were pushed back and rebuffed.  In plain language, they were trying to wrestle control of the raids, DKP and loot distribution, (the lifeblood of an endgame guild), and after a few missteps with raiding and loot distribution, they were told to back off.  Their services in this regard would no longer be required, but thank you for stepping up.  </p>
<p>They seemed fine with this.  Which should have been my first clue that they really weren&#8217;t fine with this.</p>
<p>What should have been my second clue?  You&#8217;ll have to find out tomorrow &#8212; I&#8217;ve finished my coffee.</p>

			<p>&#8230; and we&#8217;re back.</p>
<p>While ye olde blogge was in reruns, I took a stealth vacation, retooled my work schedule (NOT for the better), abused alcohol, visited the brink of death a few times, resolved not to do THAT again anytime soon, did, and kept up with the gaming news in a minimalist kind of way &#8212; which was easy because there was no news.  If there&#8217;s nothing to say, there&#8217;s nothing to say.</p>
<p>Umm.  Let&#8217;s see.  General news:  EA bought Mythic (won&#8217;t affect my life in any way).  And that&#8217;s kinda it.  </p>
<p>Warcraft news:  Patch 1.11 went live, and 1.11.1 went live during primetime raids &#8230; that was fun, if one thinks raiding at 2 in the morning is fun and none of us did.  </p>
<p>The scourge invasion was in full swing, which was fun for about a day until we all did the math on how much bag space was consumed with scourge and Argent Dawn (the hosting faction) crap.  /delete crap.  </p>
<p>The new keyrings were introduced &#8212; very popular with the non-rogue types.  </p>
<p>The new global LFG channel is not popular with anyone except the emo Myspace crowd.  </p>
<p>The new solution to instance stacking/chaining/exploiting is that players are now &#8220;Saved to this instance&#8221; any time they pass within 20 feet of a raid instance.  Ok, I exaggerate, still annoying as fuck to be spammed with &#8220;saved to this instance&#8221; on every trash kill.</p>
<p>Some more of CT-RaidAssist&#8217;s functionality was integrated into the basic WoW User Interface &#8212; again, without thanks or credit to the CTmod team.  I&#8217;ll allow that some of CTRA&#8217;s abilities are basic raiding needs that aren&#8217;t particularly innovative or, ahem, legally protected intellectual property; still, it&#8217;s long past due that Blizzard thank CTmod for all the &#8230; let&#8217;s say, inspiration.  </p>
<p>Paid character transfers became a reality, so did the heartache.  Witness:  <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?FN=wow-dungeons&#038;T=598928">someone&#8217;s guildbank taking a powder to another server</a>.  (You had to see that one coming.)  </p>
<p>My server is scheduled for paid transfer availability sometime this week and we&#8217;ve already made some friendly wagers about stealth transfers (i.e they do not warn the guild that they&#8217;re transferring):  </p>
<p>Our raid leader predicted 10 stealth transfers which we won&#8217;t care about, plus 2 more that make us OMG.  My prediction is 3 stealth transfers we won&#8217;t care about (and I named the players, I&#8217;m that good) and maybe 1 that will make us OMG.  And I added, that OMG transfer better not fucking be the guildbank or I will hunt him down like the dog he is.  </p>
<p>Other guild news from my guild, because that&#8217;s really why you&#8217;re here, you gossip whore:  One of our married players has hooked up, officially (that&#8217;s <acronym title="that's In Real Life, noob">IRL</acronym>, noobs), with one of our single players.  After telling all of us that they had sex over the weekend (we needed to know?), she announced that she&#8217;s getting divorced, officially (that&#8217;s IRL, noobs).  </p>
<p>This will not end well &#8230; for any of us.  </p>
<p>Another real life couple in the guild has been having an ongoing, rather public argument.  One raid she can&#8217;t stand to be near him and will leave midraid.  The next raid she can tolerate his virtual presence but will bitch about him the entire time.  (&#8220;Heals.  He calls those heals??&#8221;)  </p>
<p>All told, these two mini-dramas involve a druid, a hunter, a paladin and a priest &#8212; all raiders with high attendance.  !!!  Please, everyone who can read my plea, please stop fucking around with the guild healers.  Fuck the rogues all you like, but leave the healers alone.  </p>
<p>Heaven forbid two priests in my guild start fucking, then we&#8217;ll really be fucked.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> &#8212; More nothings:  <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-general&#038;t=9017014&#038;p=1&#038;tmp=1#post9017014">World of Warcraft Patch 1.11.2</a> is live today.  Find a mirror, they still can&#8217;t bittorrent worth a damn.</p>
<p><a href="http://grumpygamer.com/1623878">July&#8217;s Carnival of Gamers</a> is (has been) available at the Grumpy Gamer.  I haven&#8217;t read it just yet, so don&#8217;t spoil the ending for me.</p>

			<p>It was a little more than a year ago that the gaming buds and I turned around in World of Warcraft, and there was nowhere left to go.</p>
<p>So, we did what many have done and many will do &#8230; we looked into the raiding guilds.  It was an easy thing to do, back then, there was only two on our server &#8212; both lousy with players on our /ignore lists.  (To be fair, we were on their /ignore lists as well.)  At any rate, that was a no-way/no-how type situation.</p>
<p>Instead, we found a little raiding guild that was just beginning to work through the Molten Core content with an allied little raiding guild.  And it was good.  For about a month.</p>
<p>Fast forward about a month and we finally make the call, privately with our clique-ish selves:  wtf, our little raiding guild is just a bunch of twats.  And I mean that in every sense of the word.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, our little raiding guild alliance had some tension going down &#8230; minor power struggles, if you will, similar to sibling rivalry:  every little thing has to be split exactly down the center or there&#8217;s drama bullshit.  </p>
<p>Add our growing dissatisfaction with close twat contact every night to tense interguild relations and the sum was &#8230; we started spending most of our off-raid game time with the allied guild.  A week or two passed, and we approached the allied little raiding guild about jumping ship.  They agreed on the condition that we discuss it fully with the twats.</p>
<p>We discussed, they weren&#8217;t happy.  We discussed more, they grudgingly agreed to be adult about it.  Or maybe it was the adults agreed to it.  (I think the latter.)</p>
<p>Cue the best guild goodbye I have ever pulled off &#8212; the best part, I typed this, coincidentally, just as they had invited a new warrior into the guild:  /gu Alright, that&#8217;s it for us.  You&#8217;ve been great.  We&#8217;re headed to AlliedLittleGuild.  Goodnight everybody and see you in MC tomorrow!</p>
<p>We all /gquit simultaneously and accepted the new tag.  Showmanship.  We hit that high note and walked off.</p>
<p>There was a few more weeks of tension between the two little raiding guilds and then, one night in Molten Core, I single-handedly blew the alliance into bits.  Actually, I didn&#8217;t mean to blow it up &#8230; let&#8217;s just say that I stirred the pot a little and it blew.</p>
<p>Briefly, the twats were fucking around with the DKP system, to their benefit of course.  They asked a select few if we minded.  (Do ya MIND??)  Fuck ya, we mind.  Stop fucking around with the DKP system, they were told, in no uncertain terms.  They did anyways.  So, on that one night in Molten Core, I made an offhand remark &#8212; something like:  don&#8217;t bother spending DKP on that stuff, we can farm it for free on our own like TwatGuild does.</p>
<p>Well, apparently, AlliedLittleGuild was largely unaware of the twat shenanigans and all Hell broketh loose.  In Ventrilo.  It was loud.  Even I was surprised by the reaction.  </p>
<p>The next day, the two guildleaders decided to part ways and that was that.</p>
<p>We went through a rough period where some of our guys went to TwatGuild and some of theirs (non-twats, thankyouverymuch) joined us.  Also, people were kinda ticked off at me for a few days.  Understood.  I behaved myself for a good month after that &#8212; cleaned up the language, kept my boots shined, tabard tucked in, all that.</p>
<p>After the shakeout, we entered the Industrial Age and began to raid in earnest.  They, who were once our allies, were now our arch rivals.  And y&#8217;know how they say the best revenge is living well?  We were determined to live well.</p>
<p>Tomorrow &#8230; the gripping conclusion and a comparison of our applicant requirements then and now.  (Yes, this whole story has a point.)</p>
