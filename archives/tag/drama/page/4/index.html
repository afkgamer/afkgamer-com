			<p>Commenter Ohsnap discovered an epic World of Warcraft thread in progress from the Onyxia server:  <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=965646786&#038;postId=9653699536&#038;sid=1#0">Who Wants to be the GM of DSOL?  This is for real.</a>  Basically, it&#8217;s the old &#8220;husband and wife Warcraft team and one of the two is getting some extracurricular action&#8221;, in this case, the wife.  The husband wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hello and thank you for taking the time to read my post.</p>
<p>Contrary to what you might assume or believe, I am the GM of Dirty Sons of Liches (look me up in the armory if you doubt it) and the only remaining founder. The guild is a little over a year old, my days as GM is about to end and I need someone to take over for me.</p>
<p>As you might know, Gilgamesh is my wife in real life and has placed a significant amount of work into the guild and people are likely to respond why not give it to her. The primary reason is I intend to gkick her from the guild when I return home from work tonight.</p>
<p>As it turns out playing wow isn&#8217;t the only thing she likes to do in her free time. I hear that she is often very friendly over ventrilo&#8230;very friendly.</p>
<p>With that said, I have decided not to disband the guild- the guild deserves to live on. I would like to just give it away&#8230;.for free. Website, DKP, everything.</p>
<p>Whats the catch?</p>
<p>Simple really, I need some information. I want to know EVERYTHING. Considering Gilgamesh doesnt work, and I pay for everything, I have access to everything. Name your virtual price.</p>
<p>Visit http://www.dirtysonsofliches.com/ for my contact information.</p>
<p>Thank you very much and happy hunting.</p></blockquote>
<p>Holy crimony.</p>
<p>Many (most?) of us have seen similar in our guilds and games, but rarely do you see such &#8230; publicity, and by the wounded party no less.  Let&#8217;s call him the petitioner, because we know that&#8217;s where this is going.  (Somewhere there&#8217;s a judge about to get an intro into the underbelly of online society.  She did what?  Where?  People do that?)</p>
<p>Reply #21 by the petitioner:</p>
<blockquote><p>I also wanted to add, if you think you were the only guy that got to have some &#8220;Private Time&#8221; with my wife because you are special&#8230;you are wrong. There are 3 that I know of.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want this information so I can &#8220;Track People Down&#8221; or do anything at all. I just want to have closure and move on with my life. And in this process I hope to be able to make something good out of it- and if that means I need to give away several thousand gold or guild bank items it seems like a very small price to pay.</p></blockquote>
<p>I dunno.  If you&#8217;re an Onyxia pixel humper, I hope you&#8217;re a rogue IRL and can stealth to and from work.  </p>
<p>And finally, reply #275 (page #14) by the petitioner, apparently this isn&#8217;t the first incident &#8230; big surprise there:</p>
<blockquote><p>Just to clarify some things. We were in counseling as this happened. Ironically because she had done this in the past on a different server and it was something I was still trying to deal with. One guy she told me about the other I found out on my own.</p>
<p>Gilgamesh was the love of my life. She was everything to me, I am sorry that I could not give her everything she needed. But as she explains, I made her do this.</p>
<p>I work between 30-80 hours a week, when i get home its not uncommon for me to cook dinner for us around 10pm and watch her eat as she &#8220;Runs The Guild&#8221;. Often times I am too tired and just drink beer.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want this post to sound as if I am trying to validate what I have done here. But rather to ensure that I never allow myself to be subjected to my own blind faith and devotion.</p>
<p>She took my escape from reality, twisted it, and made it real. Now I have done the same. Perhaps she did not feel what she was doing was cheating. I wonder when she reads this if she will differentiate the between fantasy and reality then.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bonus!  An Onyxia paparazzo snapped some screenies of private conversations between an ALLEGED pixel humper and other guildmates in <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=965646786&#038;sid=1&#038;pageNo=15">reply #298 (page 15)</a>.</p>
<p>Additional resources:  <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=965797314&#038;sid=1">Encyclopedia of Demeter &#8211; Gilgamesh Drama</a>, including links to cited materials, additional media and fan club information.</p>
<p>I can add to that.  <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=442903035&#038;postId=6567774207&#038;sid=1#3">Best Gilgamesh post</a>, in hindsight:</p>
<blockquote><p> I MISS YOU CHUBBY!! Ony is just not the same now without all you guys 🙁</p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously.</p>
<p>(Good work, Ohsnap.  Way to snoop out the epic drama!)</p>
<p>UPDATE:  Oh no!  As anticipated, the forum thread got killed!  But not before I archived the entertaining material in <a href="http://www.furl.net/members/Foton">Furl</a>.  I&#8217;ll post SS&#8217;s to Flickr tomorrow (or whenever Furl is functioning again) &#8230; for the lolligaggers.</p>

			<p>Sometimes, I enjoy watching the optimism of youth.  Y&#8217;know, when I&#8217;ll warn someone in game to watch him or herself (and their virtual money) around the server jagoff and youth will tell me that I &#8220;just don&#8217;t know the server jagoff, he really is a nice person and a good player.&#8221;  Or, that &#8220;Server jagoff USED to be a jagoff but now he&#8217;s changed.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Ya.  I love optimism like that because it means they&#8217;re about to get a lesson from the school of hard knocks.</p>
<p>Like this lesson.  Remember several months ago I told you about the World of Warcraft rogue that stole the bank from the Unguildables guild?  (Parts <a href="https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/archives/2006/09/28/evolution-is-my-friend/">I</a> and <a href="https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/archives/2006/10/03/gaming-csi/">II</a>)  Briefly, this rogue kept applying to join our guild and we kept denying him, so he formed his own guild out of the server&#8217;s unguildable players &#8212; those prone to drama or ninja&#8217;ing &#8212; then he did a late-night server transfer with the guild bank and told the Unguildables he had cut a deal with my guild for all of the them to join all of us in happy raid land.</p>
<p>I may have also told you (maybe I didn&#8217;t though), he returned to our server on a level one noobie rogue WITH THE SAME NAME as his thief character and was chatting it up with the crowd in Ironforge.</p>
<p>This is how that night went down.  A few of us are sitting around in Ironforge after the night&#8217;s 40-man raid, marveling that our guild can kill anything with some of the &#8220;talent&#8221; we have, and I see in /say his noobie rogue chatting with a couple of our guild (ALLEGEDLY) female players.  Let&#8217;s say his rogue is named Beneful.</p>
<p>Me:  /officer wtf.  is that fucking beneful?<br />
Officer channel:  He transferred.  Remember??  He stole that guild bank.<br />
Me:  /officer Well I&#8217;m looking right at him in Ironforge.  Who the fuck else would name their character with that dumass name?<br />
Officer channel:  Wow.  That&#8217;s ballsy.<br />
Me: (to one of the females chatting with him) Is that fucking beneful?<br />
Her:  teehee ya.  He made a level 1 to chat with people.  He&#8217;s lonely on his new server.<br />
Me thinks:  Musta run out of money.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, in this situation I&#8217;d be on high alert to carefully scour any rogue applicant to keep his thieving ass out of the guild, but as we hadn&#8217;t tagged a new rogue since 2005, high alert seemed unwarranted.</p>

			<p>Ok folks, <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=106735058&#038;sid=1">this World of Warcraft forum thread</a> is one of those game dramas that is SO GOOD, you actually start camping the message board to watch the explosion in real time.</p>
<p>Which is exactly what I did &#8212; despite protests from my weekend game groups, but to hell with them, this was/IS good shit.</p>
<p>For the firewall-challenged, here&#8217;s a few excerpts to tantalize.</p>
<p>Title:  <strong>Drama is a guy</strong>  (&#8230; and usually a whore, but that&#8217;s a philosophical discussion.)</p>
<p>Drama of the Norgannon realm wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think it&#8217;s time to end this little charade. I&#8217;m a guy.</p>
<p>Back when I my GF was leveling characters, she had a mixed variety of male and female characters. She noticed that without any indication by the player, most people assumed male characters were guys IRL and female characters were girls IRL. She also noticed that people were much more pleasant towards her female characters than her male characters. She thought this was a surprising, yet offending observation. Sexists exist, ladies and gents, even in WoW.</p>
<p>When she finally got me interested enough in the game to go buy a copy and start leveling a character, she suggested that I make a female character, and pretend to be female. She told me that it would make the whole gaming experience more enjoyable because people would actually be a lot nicer to you if they thought you were female IRL. Along with this discussion went which class and race to pick. She suggested warrior because a skilled protection warrior in end game is highly sought after&#8230; Anyway this is beside the point.</p>
<p>We decided that to avoid obvious complications with men trying to flirt with me, she and I were to be @!!*!!!s. I borrowed some pictures of her and her sister to use in the creation of the myspace link seen in the signature of all of my posts predating this one. Even though I claimed I was happy in a very flourishing relationship, some guys insisted on coming on to me which was quite frankly very creepy and disgusting.</p>
<p>At times it was kinda fun when people would offer to run me through instances for free. Other times it was creepy and sometimes scary when certain guys in particular just wouldn&#8217;t accept &#8220;*#** off&#8221; as an answer. I guess you could say this experience has enlightened me in some ways.</p>
<p>I feel I have mislead many by pretending to be someone I am not and for this I do apologize. I did my best to steer clear of obvious complications such as faking falling in love with anyone, or otherwise leading anyone to believe that they had a chance with me. If you are heartbroken, check your package. Is it still there? Good. You&#8217;ll get over it.</p>
<p>I am a very straight male who was merely curious about some of the things the other side goes through when dealing with men on the internet. I am both shocked and disgusted at some of the ways in which I was treated while I was pretending to be Jennifer. I will neither name names, nor will I get specific as to what actually happened between these unnamed persons and myself. It is history.</p>
<p>Forum trolls feast upon the grandest thing to come your way since the birth of the server.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, if you&#8217;ve been around online gaming for a while (i.e. longer than 30 minutes), you know already this story hasn&#8217;t played out and will only get better.  (Pssst, you were right!)</p>
<p>Further reading and it seems Drama (self-described heterosexual male) was pretending, in game, to be a lesbian in real life.  As you do.  </p>
