								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cuppycake of Cuppytalk showed us <a href="http://www.cuppycake.org/?p=110">Herspace</a> and wants to see other blogger&#8217;s Gamespace.</p>
<p>Myspace, carefully annotated and cleverly anonymized because I didn&#8217;t cheat and vacuum right before the photo:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afkgamer/552125292/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1033/552125292_b1b3f7aeca.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Foton Gamespace Annotated" class="center" /></a></p>
<p>What you don&#8217;t see:  the aforementioned unvacuumed floor, 15 stacks of books and 4 stacks of CDs, 2 bags of camera equipment and the dog sprawled on the floor licking the subwoofer.  (WHY? WHY?)</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Zonk of <a href="http://www.mmognation.com/2006/12/31/five-things/">MMOGNation</a> emailed that I was on deck for the blog chain letter, &#8220;This Will Never Make You Rich, but tell us 5 incredibly personal things about yourself anyways&#8221;.</p>
<p>Abalieno (of <a href="http://www.cesspit.net/drupal/node/1586">Cesspit</a>) and Dundee (of <a href="http://mythicalblog.com/blog/2006/12/29/five-5-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-me/">Mythical</a>) also tagged (and they were tagged by two friends &#8230; and so on &#8230; and so on) but they didn&#8217;t email and I usually don&#8217;t read the feed until Tuesday-ish &#8212; so no extra credit for them.</p>
<p>Just so you know, don&#8217;t send me a Myspace meme asking for 5 celebrities I&#8217;d do or 5 flavors I love because I won&#8217;t respond and the chain will die with you.  I&#8217;m sure you already know how dangerous that would be.</p>
<p>Five Things You Probably Don&#8217;t Know About Me.  (Well, how could you unless I told you?)</p>
<p>1.  I graduated from the University of Illinois, aka The U of I.  If you ever hear an Iowa alumnus refer to Iowa as The U of I, you have my permission to punch him (or her) in the face.  Fucking posers.</p>
<p>2.  My great room has been under major remodeling construction for the past two years.  Original estimate &#8211; three months.  I don&#8217;t want to talk about it.</p>
<p>3.  I can&#8217;t sing.  You know how moms always say you can be anything you want to when you grow up?  Mine qualified that with &#8220;&#8230; but not a singer.&#8221;</p>
<p>4.  I&#8217;m a music hag.  My collection, at last count, totaled over 1500 CDs plus a 6-foot stack of vinyl.  If you stop over at my house some day, bring your iPod, I&#8217;ll hook you up.  Don&#8217;t ask about the construction though or you&#8217;ll be out on your ass.</p>
<p>5.  I still have every box from every MMOG I have ever purchased, including the expansions.  I actually pack the boxes in other boxes when I move.  I just now realized how ridiculous that is.</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;m the last blogger responding (great), the bad luck is all mine &#8230; that is &#8230; unless &#8230; yes, it could work.  I&#8217;m going to tag YOU, the AFK Gamer commenter community.  If you have a blog and you&#8217;d like to join in, pop a trackback or ping to this post.  If you&#8217;re not a blogger, give me 5 in the comments.  Don&#8217;t be shy, takes 5 minutes, otherwise I&#8217;m doomed to bad blogger luck &#8212; which for me means guild tranquillity.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re new to AFK Gamer, here&#8217;s a list of <a href="https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/archives/category/noteworthy/">Favorite Posts</a>, excerpted, in reverse chrono order &#8212; sometimes I hit the high notes.  </p>
<p>Many of the AFK Gamer images are hosted on Flickr, the exemplary photo sharing site, in the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/afkgamer/">Screenshot Gallery</a>.
