<p>Interesting.  Very, very interesting.</p>
<p>(The rest of the press release is entertaining reading &#8212; don&#8217;t miss it.  Those young go-getters with their unique mix of talents from Wall Street and gaming!  Their Wall Street-developed platform has GOT to be good!  And safe!)</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s an interesting debate on the World of Warcraft forums about a player who games from around the world because of business travel:  <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=70808749&#038;sid=1&#038;pageNo=1">&#8220;Play WoW on business trips and get suspended?&#8221;</a></p>
<p>You might think by the title that he got suspended from work for exploring the Tower of Azora with a group of night elves &#8212; not so.  He was suspended from Warcraft for exploring the Tower of Azora from multiple IP addresses.  </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume the Original Poster is telling the truth, and I&#8217;m inclined to do so, what should a MMOG company&#8217;s policy be with accounts that are accessed by multiple IPs?  Clearly there are legitimate, <acronym title="you WILL obey the Terms of Service">TOS</acronym>-compliant reasons when a player would use several IPs to access his/her account.  Conversely, there are non-legit, TOS-breaking reasons also.</p>
<p>Suspend first, argue later?  Ask first, suspend later?  Say nothing, spy on the player at the Tower of Azora?  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m leaning towards flagging the account and looking for other suspicious behavior connected to the account.  </p>
<p>My opinion, this shouldn&#8217;t be a high priority for investigations.  Realize, however, that I&#8217;m in the &#8220;I don&#8217;t care if people sell/buy virtual currency and accounts&#8221; camp.  People in the &#8220;I think selling/buying virtual currency and accounts is wrong&#8221; camp might consider this a higher priority and some collateral damage is expected and acceptable.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll qualify that with &#8220;FOR THE MOST PART, I don&#8217;t care if people sell/buy virtual currency and accounts camp&#8221;.  I&#8217;ll illustrate with a high quality graphic.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afkgamer/368951310/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/368951310_b1e94d376f_o.jpg" width="400" height="294" alt="Gold Sellers Chart" class="center" /></a></p>
<p>Ya see?  We&#8217;re not so different you and I.  (In fact, I used to be much more fundamentalist in my view on IGE/Ebaying game stuffs.  Over the years, I moved towards the &#8220;fuckit, I don&#8217;t care&#8221; side of the high quality graphic.)</p>
<p>Back to the original question:  how to limit collateral damage when on a seek-and-destroy TOS-violators mission?</p>
