There is reading available for every budget, even you starving gamers who are reading this from the public library computers.  </p>
<p>Speaking of clearance sales, going cheap, my primary Warcraft account:  Level 60 Human Rogue, PVE-US server, PVP rank 9, reasonable reputation on the server, (and by that I mean I&#8217;m on a few ignore lists, but that&#8217;s nothing some apologies and a few minutes of insincere flattery won&#8217;t solve), and, as a special bonus, I&#8217;ll even throw in my guild for free &#8212; #3 in spendable DKP, baby!!  Grab what you want with both hands!  (Minors are advised to turn on the in-game word censor.)</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>:  No, you can&#8217;t buy my stuff.  Yet.  However, each week of drama brings new hope.<br />
<strong>Also</strong>:  The next Carnival of Gamers will be hosted by <a href="http://blog.pjsattic.com/corvus/">Man Bytes Blog</a> in October 2006.</p>

<p>You are nothing to me.  Less than nothing.  Had I desired your head, it would have been presented to me on a pike.</p>
<p>You have made the mistake that all mortals make.</p>
<p>*Lord Victor Nefarius sighs.*</p>
<p>Time does strange things to those that use it as a form of currency.</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve made no mistakes.</em></p>
<p><strong>In your rush to glory, you assumed that the pace of the game revolved around your actions.  Can you even fathom how preposterous that sounds to a being like me?  A being that if so inclined could cause your own insignificant thoughts to crush the peanut sized mass of grey matter floating within your skull.</strong></p>
<p><em>You have lost your mind, Nefarius.  You speak in riddles.</em></p>
<p><strong>It is simple really!  Allow me to summarize&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><em>Please do.</em></p>
<p><strong>In this world where time is your enemy, it is my greatest ally.  This grand game of life that you think you play in fact plays you.  To that I say&#8230;</p>
<p>Let the games begin!</strong></small></p>
<p>The one-year anniversary of <a href="http://buttonmashing.com/2006/05/04/carnival-of-gamers-14/">the Carnival of Gamers is available</a> on buttonmashing, representing the collective work of over twenty gaming blogs.</p>
<p>Thanks to Tony of buttonmashing for organizing, prodding and sweating out the Carnival this past year &#8212; it could not have been easy at times.  Accolades also to participants, past and present, who maintain a heavy gaming schedule AND write about it.  How do we do it?!?  </p>
<p>Mostly liquor and magic.</p>
<p>Until next week then, Foton out.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t go read it now!  If you&#8217;re going to play Warcraft tonight, save that link for the corpse run after Blackwing Lair&#8217;s Broodlord &#8230; y&#8217;know, when the instance starts to sputter and your casters use those famous last words, &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure this is going to work with the casting lag&#8221;, and you all decide to give it a try anyways because you don&#8217;t want to sit in the Suppression Room forever, so you dive in and shortly thereafter, your third tank starts getting his (or her) beatdown while the healers stare at perma-casting flash heals, and after the last rogue and hunter has been wtf-pwnt and you&#8217;re facing a run from the Searing Gorge graveyard through no fault of your own (this time), THEN take some time to read through the varied entries in this month&#8217;s Carnival.</p>
<p>I know you&#8217;ll be tempted to have the entire guild file an in-game petition, but reading the Carnival is a much better use of your corpse-recovery time and less likely to get your account banned for foul language.</p>
