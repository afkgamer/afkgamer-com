Summary:  Family purchases Nintendo Wii on launch day, optical drive deteriorates, Nintendo invites family and the errant Wii to the Nintendo campus for a quick exchange.  Screenshots or it didn&#8217;t happen?  Ha!  Photos included.</p>

(I dunno, it&#8217;s some game thing, supposed to be good for you.)</p>
<p>Few things I thought of this week:  #1 &#8211; I&#8217;m not big on the future.  I&#8217;m not much interested in what I might be able to buy some day.  Tell me what I can buy NOW.  </p>
<p>#2 &#8211; I hope no one ever writes a book called <strong>The Mathematics of Multiplayer Online Gaming</strong> because what a snooze that would be.</p>
<p>#3 &#8211; Please, please, please announce the new Alliance race for the World of Warcraft expansion soon.  I&#8217;m not much interested, but I&#8217;m tired of the speculation and rumors.  We all are.  End it already.  (UPDATE:  Thank God that&#8217;s over.  It&#8217;s Draenei.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/09/technology/10warcraft.web.html?ex=1304827200&#038;en=3a679d1103134e90&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss">NYT wouldn&#8217;t print it if it wasn&#8217;t true</a>.  Also, longish <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/09/technology/10warcraftqa.web.html">NYT interview with Blizzard&#8217;s (Tigole) Jeff Kaplan</a>.)</p>
<p>#4 &#8211; There&#8217;s no way in Hell I will spend $500 and change on a game system unless it will blow me too.  What functions could said system possibly perform, short of the aforementioned blowing, that my other pieces of electronica can&#8217;t do already?  None, that&#8217;s what.  </p>
<p>#5 &#8211; This porta-crapper reminded me of the new Nintendo controller, Wii, the subject of much hype-o-drama at the E3 this year.  I came back the next day to get a photo.  That&#8217;s how dedicated to my craft I am.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I absolutely loved this story from last week, from Philadelphia&#8217;s Channel 6 ACTION!!!! News:  <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=special_coverage&#038;id=3905371">The Nintendo DS System</a>, which, according to the crack team of reporters at Channel 6 ACTION!!! News, can and is being used by creepy adults to stalk budding artists like 11 year-old Emily Keel.  Here&#8217;s the punchline:  even according to ACTION!!! News&#8217; own web writeup, the creeps &#8220;&#8230; must also be using another DS system and be within 65 feet.&#8221;  Umm, maybe that crack team of reporters could have scouted around Emily&#8217;s neighborhood and caught the stalker in the bushes.  <strong>Or</strong>, they could stop making up stuff.  ACTION!!! News had <a href="http://www.gamerdad.com/detail.cfm?itemID=3047">contacted GamerDad&#8217;s David Long</a> about Pictochat, Emily&#8217;s preferred DS app, before their report aired.  Long writes:  &#8220;I also said at least three or four times that Pictochat was not Internet enabled &#8230;&#8221; and &#8220;I stated specifically that Pictochat would still not work because it doesn&#8217;t ever make any connection with a network as it has no means of connecting to an Internet Service Provider (ISP).&#8221;  I still wish ACTION!!! News would have taken a walk around Emily&#8217;s &#8216;hood, beating the bushes, looking for the creepy DS stalker.
