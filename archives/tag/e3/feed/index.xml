								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If the ESA was really serious about <a href="http://www.theesa.com/archives/2006/07/for_immediate_r.php">downsizing and revamping the annual circus that is E3</a>, they could just have the attendees log onto their World of Warcraft accounts and run around in Silverpine Forest or The Barrens.  Toss in a few night elves dancing in their virtual underwear, a few macro&#8217;d keynote speeches and a /random casino or two and you&#8217;ve got yourself a party.</p>

(I dunno, it&#8217;s some game thing, supposed to be good for you.)</p>
<p>Few things I thought of this week:  #1 &#8211; I&#8217;m not big on the future.  I&#8217;m not much interested in what I might be able to buy some day.  Tell me what I can buy NOW.  </p>
<p>#2 &#8211; I hope no one ever writes a book called <strong>The Mathematics of Multiplayer Online Gaming</strong> because what a snooze that would be.</p>
<p>#3 &#8211; Please, please, please announce the new Alliance race for the World of Warcraft expansion soon.  I&#8217;m not much interested, but I&#8217;m tired of the speculation and rumors.  We all are.  End it already.  (UPDATE:  Thank God that&#8217;s over.  It&#8217;s Draenei.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/09/technology/10warcraft.web.html?ex=1304827200&#038;en=3a679d1103134e90&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss">NYT wouldn&#8217;t print it if it wasn&#8217;t true</a>.  Also, longish <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/09/technology/10warcraftqa.web.html">NYT interview with Blizzard&#8217;s (Tigole) Jeff Kaplan</a>.)</p>
<p>#4 &#8211; There&#8217;s no way in Hell I will spend $500 and change on a game system unless it will blow me too.  What functions could said system possibly perform, short of the aforementioned blowing, that my other pieces of electronica can&#8217;t do already?  None, that&#8217;s what.  </p>
<p>#5 &#8211; This porta-crapper reminded me of the new Nintendo controller, Wii, the subject of much hype-o-drama at the E3 this year.  I came back the next day to get a photo.  That&#8217;s how dedicated to my craft I am.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Proposal:  <a href="http://www.e3unveiled.com/about.html">Veteran E3 attendees from Colorado Springs are making a documentary</a> about this year&#8217;s swag-fest to give &#8220;&#8230; an unprecedented look of E3 that no one&#8217;s been shown before: from the outside-in. It&#8217;s the goal of this documentary that we inspire, educate, or at least entertain viewers about an event that&#8217;s always been dangled out of reach of the average gamer.&#8221;  Problem:  they need $15,000 for equipment and production supplies.  Solution:  You and your kind donations.  (To date:  $414 collected.)  And when I say &#8220;You&#8221;, I mean &#8220;Not me&#8221; because I think this is what credit cards and generous retail return policies are for.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you all know, this <a href="http://www.e3expo.com/">E3 thing</a> is this week.  HA!  Did you know?  I was only vaguely aware because I read the <a href="https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/links/">better blogs</a>.  </p>
<p>But here&#8217;s what I was wondering.  Do players, y&#8217;know, just gamer people, go to this thing?  I&#8217;m thinking they do.  This strikes me as far too much of a commitment to a hobby than I&#8217;m willing to give.  Is it me?  Am I wrong?  </p>
<p>Everything&#8217;s leaked on the net two hours after it&#8217;s finalized anyhow, so how could there possibly be any unheard of, unseen shiny?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, plenty of blogs and news sites are covering the amazing! must-see! fun of an industry <del>media event</del> convention, including one blog, that I won&#8217;t name, with a fucked newsfeed that sends all their old posts as new material every time my feed reader refreshes.  (Ever hear of adding your own feed to a reader to check that it&#8217;s operational?)</p>
<p>Best coverage that I&#8217;ve seen is Amit&#8217;s of <a href="http://www.damnedmachines.com/">These Damned Machines Are Killing Me</a>.  Of the myriad sites providing wall-to-wall, he&#8217;s one of the few that isn&#8217;t just pumping up the punctuation on press releases and doing a reblog.</p>
<p>Sure hope the food gets better for him, brave lil trooper.</p>
