				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Part III of the week-long series on human waste in gaming society &#8230; today, I have a story about a liar, a cheat and a thief &#8212; one person with multiple talents for leaving misery in his wake. So he&#8217;s got that going for him. Which is nice.</p>
<p>Of course, I&#8217;ve run across many thieves and cheats in online gaming, but I selected this assbanger for his completely-unrepentant behavior. I&#8217;ve seen my share of ninja looters, noob scammers, trade loggers, and loot whores &#8212; this fucker though &#8230; he was something else. <span class="fullpost"></p>
<p>During our first few months on the EverQuest premium server, my gaming buds and I were in a raiding guild that spent a lot of time farming the Temple of Veeshan (just breaking into the NToV, for those who know what that is) and during our &#8220;free&#8221; time, we would farm the Kunark dragons, for fun and guild profit. A raiding guild in EQ burns through the platinum pieces faster than a crack ho with a bad shopping habit, so we regularly did plat raids.</p>
<p>One night, when the guild raid leader (my best bud) and I were offline, the guild slew one of the dragons and hit the jackpot, lootwise. The guild would have been set for platinum for at least a week except one problem &#8230; the loot disappeared. No, not a game bug &#8212; no one would admit to having the loot. (ya, it was a ninja problem. damn ninjas.)</p>
<p>For some reason, that became clear in hindsight, the Guild Leader accused my bud and me of ninja&#8217;ing the loot. And he didn&#8217;t make the accusations privately so we could defend ourselves and maybe clear this up, he voiced his bullshit accusation in the guild channel when we were still offline the next day. Later on, we both log on and are greeted by hate tells. (and a very good day to you, too!)</p>
<p>We both reminded the guild that we weren&#8217;t even online the previous evening, which a senior member in the guild (thankfully) remembered and confirmed to the murderous mob. One of the 15 year old punkasses suggested that maybe we had passed along the loot (that we never had seen) to one of our alt characters and that we should still be strung up by our plate boots.</p>
<p>Seeing that this bullshit was going nowhere fast, my bud and I called the GMs to come and check our accounts for the loot and reassure the guild that none of our characters had even so much as touched the loot. (This was back in the OLDEN TIMES when Sony actually had a GM/CSR staff.) The GM checked all of our characters and reported to a senior guild member that we were not the ninjas they sought.</p>
<p>Curiously, we didn&#8217;t see our much-beloved Guild Leader for several days &#8230; unusual, as he had been a daily player until the incident. You can probably guess where this is going.</p>
<p>Few more days pass, and one of our more industrious guildmates makes a character on our Guild Leader&#8217;s home server and does some snooping around with the /who all command. Sure enough, there he be, running around the common gathering area, auctioning off the purloined lewt, which also now includes the entire guild bank. (thanks for stopping!)</p>
<p>As our industrious guildie put it so well and so succinctly, &#8220;Wow, he really had a lot to sell.&#8221; </span></p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Continuing with my week-long series about the solid waste at the bottom of society&#8217;s septic tank&#8230;</p>
<p>Few years back, in lovely EverQuest, I was playing on the premium server. This server was, by this time, only premium in its monthly fee; there really weren&#8217;t any benefits to playing there other than a lower population (albeit ALL level 65 characters of end-game raiding caliber). Hail, nightly races to whatever spawns we could scoop up!</p>
<p>Two of my fellow servermates were a real life married couple that had also originated from my home server, so I was very familiar with the kind of shit these two skanks would pull in the name of &#8220;roleplay&#8221;. Naturally, I didn&#8217;t acknowledge their existence and, fortunately for me, they joined a rival guild so our paths didn&#8217;t cross very often.</p>
<p>After they had been guilded with my rivals for a time, word started leaking out about their cyber antics &#8230; and I don&#8217;t mean antics with each other. *nudge nudge* Being the jaded gaming hag that I am, I don&#8217;t give much credence to cyber rumors &#8212; it&#8217;s one of the standard insults, particularly useful when attempting to insult a female: &#8220;Soandso cybers everyone!&#8221; &#8220;Soandso is really a guy, irl!&#8221;. You get the idea.</p>
<p>Apparently, Skank One and Skank Two decided to step up the cyber a notch because Mrs. Skank posted naked pictures of herself on their guild private message boards. How do I know this? BECAUSE THEIR GUILD SHARED SAID PICS WITH THE ENTIRE EQ GAMING COMMUNITY. How do I know the pics were really of her? Because Team Skank became infuriated and started threatening lawsuits and, basically, confirmed that the pics were genuine.</p>
<p>There were also rumblings that Mrs. (and Mr.) Skank had been trying to work out various real life hookups with guildmates. (run, run very very far away!!) As they never solicited me or any of my real life buds, I don&#8217;t know how valid this is, but I have a good guess.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few weeks, and the pics have made their way over to my home server&#8217;s privately-run message boards. Several pages of flames, hearty laughter and almost-audible wretching later, Mrs. Skank calls up the message board host company to complain and issue the standard Skank Lawsuit Threat. (wtf, how is anyone else responsible for your hosebaggery?) Host company is the employer of an EQ player from my home server, and he is promptly fired for (I&#8217;m guessing) moral turpitude &#8212; which frankly was not HIS turpitude, but the Skanks.</p>
<p>The message boards were shut down and eventually found another home, away from the Skanks, although if you were to visit the new boards to this very day, you will find a subliminal &#8220;FU Skank&#8221; in the logo and a warning to not post the Skank pics (even though you might be very tempted to do so). I&#8217;ve heard that you can Kaaza the pics, if you knew the Skanks&#8217; character names and if you were very very very very very drunk and possibly had a serious head injury also.</p>
<p>That, in a nutsack, is how to create your very own Legendary personal p0rn. Legendary, in more ways than one.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Gaming message boards are, almost without exception, a complete waste of time.&nbsp; You might find a nugget of useful information there, but you&#8217;ll have to wade through complaints, false accusations and incomprehensible l337 d3wd sp34k and chest thumping&nbsp;to find anything worthwhile.&nbsp; As far as I&#8217;ve been able to tell, message board communities are for mocking other players and wasting (what would otherwise be) productive work or school&nbsp;hours. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s been my observation that over 90 percent of posters can be categorized into one of the following profiles: </p>
<p>The Attention Ho &#8211; Look at me!&nbsp; Look what I&#8217;m doing now!&nbsp; Respond to my thread! Definintely, the most prolific posters around &#8212;&nbsp;every minor victory, every inconsequential slight and every excrutiating minutae of their virtual and real lives is documented in great detail.&nbsp; (The attention ho will also usually dabble in incredibly bad roleplay fan fiction.)&nbsp; JFC, wipe the cheeto dust off your fingers and realize that no one gives a fuck what you&#8217;re doing. </p>
<p>The Drama Queen &#8211; O M G, I&#8217;m quitting the game!&nbsp; O M G, Soandso stole my noob mob!&nbsp; O M G, you will NOT believe how mean PowerGamer04 was to me!&nbsp; O M G stfu!&nbsp; Not only am I not surprised that you&#8217;re the game&#8217;s whipping boy, I wish that I had been the one doing the whipping.&nbsp; And btw, fucking quit already &#8212; I just know you&#8217;re going to return to the boards FOR MONTHS to annoy us all. </p>
<p>The Moral Barometer &#8211; These types chime in on every single thread involving any sort of game dispute, no matter how minor, with their self-important judgmental bullshit.&nbsp; Get a clue Judge Judy, only the ho&#8217;s and queens bring their disputes to message boards.&nbsp; Everyone else, and this is SHOCKING, settles their disputes in private rather than parade them on the internet. </p>
<p>Post Count Ho &#8211; This buttmuncher is just farming post count totals, because that statistic alone proves how super popular they are (on the internet).&nbsp; They bump all the ho&#8217;s and queens&#8217; threads, they bump every single auction of in-game items &#8230;&nbsp;no matter how STUPID the auction is &#8230;&nbsp;they bump all their guildmates&#8217; threads (*bump* for my homey in the guild!), and some will resort to necro-bumping (resurrecting old, ancient threads) just to enhance their leet post count.&nbsp; FYI, dumass, *bump* is not content and post counts don&#8217;t translate to dick size. </p>
<p>The Ghet-TOE Banger &#8211; Their board shit is peppered with alot of lingo, PROVING that they are not an internet nerd, but rather an incredibly cool person IRL that just stumbled onto the message board.&nbsp; (ya, right)&nbsp; They do a lot of posturing about their posses, their biatches, yo yo, werd bro, runnin wit da guildies to fuck shit up.&nbsp; Get over yourself, yo! </p>
<p>The best way to deal with all these assclowns is to just stay away from gaming message boards.&nbsp; Sure, it&#8217;s tempting to open Pandora&#8217;s Box just a tiny bit and peek inside, but once you do, you&#8217;ll want to rip your eyeballs out and stomp on them.&nbsp; And trust me on this, you won&#8217;t find any useful information there, so just google what you seek far, far away. </p>
<p>Even 23,980,590 pop-up ads&nbsp;are better than that shit. </p>
