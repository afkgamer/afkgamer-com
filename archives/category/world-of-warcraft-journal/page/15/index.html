				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Last week, I began the story of <a href="https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/archives/2006/09/01/updates-or-how-the-stories-end/">a recent problem we had with a former guild member</a> &#8212; I&#8217;ll call her BabbleOn, because she could babble on and on.  She was the kind of guild alumnus who just won&#8217;t move on to those greener pastures and that fuller, richer real life and as the primary targets of her incessant IM/email/game chat, the raidleader and I decided that something would have to be done &#8230; for the good of the guild.  Yes, yes, for the good of the guild!  Tranquility, security, pursuit of happiness must be preserved.</p>
<p>Now y&#8217;all who&#8217;re without sin can cast the first stone.  With the benefit of hindsight, maybe it wasn&#8217;t such a hot idea &#8230; but at the time, my little plan seemed like the solution to all our problems, and the answer to all our prayers.</p>
<p>As the raidleader and I were discussing one day what to do with a problem like BabbleOn, I suggested that he could get rid of her by coming on to her.  My reasoning (after a few drinks in a long PVP play session) was that one of two things would happen:  1.  She would e-slap him and tell him never to talk to her again or, 2. Her husband would threaten to hospitalize him.  I was kind of hoping for 2., because that would be some funny shit.  </p>
<p>I forgot about possibility 3:  She would dig it.</p>
<p>The Vent convo, pre-raid:</p>
<p>Raidleader:  Well, I tried out that little plan of yours today with *BabbleOn&#8217;sGameName*.<br />
Me:  Really.  How&#8217;d that work out?<br />
RL:  She&#8217;s INTO it.<br />
Me:  Heh, no shit.  What&#8217;d you say, specifically?<br />
RL:  I said that we should be more than friends.<br />
Me:  That&#8217;s it?<br />
RL:  Ya.<br />
Me:  There&#8217;s your problem right there.  You&#8217;re too subtle.  What the fuck is more than friends?  That&#8217;s like best friends forevah?  Email pals?<br />
RL:  Ok, fine.  If it&#8217;ll get her to shut up and leave me alone, will be worth it.<br />
Me:  Roger that.</p>
<p>Raidleader continued on with his e-flirting, she continued to dig it and I was blissfully left out of it.  As far as I was concerned, the plan had worked like a charm.  The one day, her husband must have spied on her emails or done some shoulder surfing, because she reprimanded the raidleader for going too far and said her husband was upset.  Whatever.  He should come kick my ass, was my idea.  Anyways.</p>
<p>She only talked to me once during this time and it was to ask me if I&#8217;d champion the idea of her and her husband returning to the guild, y&#8217;know, assuming they would ever return to World of Warcraft, which they kind of already had since they logged in each night to talk to people.  (Ya, I don&#8217;t get that either.  I&#8217;m not that into people that I&#8217;d log into a game solely to chat.)  I asked her in return, &#8220;Why would I even ask since you&#8217;ve said several times that you guys would never rejoin?&#8221;  Her response, &#8220;It&#8217;s always nice to be invited.&#8221;  At that point, I escaped into a battleground, frightened that I still had psycho aggro.  </p>
<p>The one day, on a weekend it must have been, we were guild PVP&#8217;ing.  Between matches, I noticed on the Ventrilo server two names I did not recognize in a private channel.  Having admin rights, I popped into the channel and asked the intruders to identify themselves.  They said they were friends of a guildmate of ours.  &#8220;Who?&#8221; asked I.  They made up a name.  </p>
<p>Since our Vent server has always been password-protected, although we rarely change the password, this meant that some former member, or a previous guest of ours, had passed along the Vent info to his buddies in case they ever wanted a free, high-quality Vent experience one day &#8230; emphasis on FREE.  I invited them to leave and the raidleader changed the password immediately, posting the new password on our private guildmembers-only message boards.  We joked that this would also solve our problem with BabbleOn logging into our Vent all the time and we could just blame the intruders.  Too bad, so sad.</p>
<p>Problems solved.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afkgamer/110469984/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/42/110469984_00cae13888_m.jpg" width="228" height="240" alt="Air Guitar with a Benediction" class="alignleft" /></a>Pictured:  my priest alt, screwing around by the Tinker-dudes mailbox in Ironforge.  I had to abandon my regular tile in Ironforge, too many noobs hanging out begging for gold, asking where I got suchandsuch piece of gear, or, can they join my guild.  (No, Blackwing Lair, and no.)</p>
<p>Updates, because everyone wants to know how the story ends:  Recall the lying <a href="https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/archives/2006/08/11/i-am-the-master/">&#8220;I&#8217;m ebaying/IGEing&#8221; rogue</a> that left our guild a few weeks back, immediately after <a href="https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/archives/2006/08/10/i-still-hate-people/">the departure of two insurgents</a> who tried to grab lasting guild power and failed.  Whatever happened with all of that?  Well, the rogue&#8217;s application to a rival guild was closed and denied that same day, as I wrote previously, and he eventually landed in a guild that we call, affectionately, the Guild for the Unguildables.  Every member is a former member of a raiding guild and has &#8230; let&#8217;s say, baggage &#8230; in other words, a tattered reputation.</p>
<p>Recall that as the rogue was trying to salvage his application to the rival guild, he claimed that the two insurgents could vouch for him and his avatar.  That was one of the tipping points for the two jackasses&#8217; applications &#8212; they were also denied and shown the exit.  From my super-leet sleuthing, I found out that subpar DPS and subpar tanking were also issues in their guild auditions.  Hey!  That&#8217;s exactly the problem we noticed, too!  </p>
<p>Don&#8217;t feel badly for them.  They landed in a raiding guild only a few rungs down the progression ladder.  When I say &#8220;a few rungs down&#8221;, I mean they get to endure Nefarian learning all over again.  Welcome to early 2006.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve put some effort into maintaining friendships within our guild &#8212; y&#8217;know, testing out whether a reconciliation might be possible &#8212; one of them PVPs alot on his mage alt and he&#8217;ll buff my rogue with intelligence whenever we cross paths (???), but whatever, that bridge was burned.  Have a nice life.</p>
<p>I had <a href="https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/archives/2006/08/30/the-warcraft-pvp-grind/">semi-sorta promised the story</a> about the PVPing, former guildmember, won&#8217;t-speak-to-either-me-or-our-raidleader, chick.  Here&#8217;s how that all happened:  about six months ago this chick and her husband (that&#8217;s real life spouse) were raiding guildmates of ours.  Good raiders, excellent attendance, some of the best gear in our guild.  The chick was an officer in our guild, too, although she was a bit prone to quitting the officer position with regularity.  She was given One More Chance at the officer position, with the understanding that if she quit this time, she would never be offered officer again, because hell, enough is enough.</p>
<p>Everything went along just fine for a few weeks with the One More Chance.  Then, one night, I don&#8217;t even know what the hell happened, but this is what I witnessed.  She made a post on our boards about new plans she had for recruiting and new ideas she had for easing the integration of new members into the raiding core, etc. etc.  It all sounded great &#8212; she really was one of our best officers when she wasn&#8217;t quitting or threatening to quit.  A few hours after that post, she announced that she and her husband were quitting Warcraft for good, they were going to focus on family life with no more gaming, and she wished us all well.</p>
<p>What in the &#8230;  </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my theory:  something happened that night in those few hours that forced a game-quit.  7:00 pm, everybody&#8217;s happy.  11:00 pm, they&#8217;re outta here.  Doesn&#8217;t make sense otherwise.  I also have a theory of what that something was, but it&#8217;s only speculation from knowing her personality and *cough* behaviors.  Nevertheless, they&#8217;re out and we wished them well in return.  And meant it.</p>
<p>Over the following weeks, she would occasionally email or IM me and our raidleader, as we were good friends with her in the guild.  We were, in fact, among her few supporters because she had a tendency to be short with guildmates which was not endearing.  And I&#8217;ll say here, this was because she is a woman.  We have male officers that are similarly terse and demanding, but they don&#8217;t get the bad rap that she did.  Ya, it&#8217;s unfair, but this is life.  </p>
<p>Well, she must have been getting bored at work and with no game in her free time, because she gradually stepped up the emailing and IM&#8217;ing to the point of nuisance.  She reinstalled Warcraft solely to chat with us during raids.  (Hi?  I&#8217;m in Blackwing Lair?  Kinda busy here.)  She&#8217;d log into the guild&#8217;s Ventrilo server and chat with the guild there, too.  I think you can imagine how out of control this was becoming.</p>
<p>The raidleader and I talked about how we could solve this without being complete assholes about it.  That&#8217;s me rationalizing.  Remember, we didn&#8217;t START OUT intending to be complete assholes.  That&#8217;s me clinging to a fine line as I rationalize.</p>
<p>Next week &#8230; we are complete assholes about it.</p>
