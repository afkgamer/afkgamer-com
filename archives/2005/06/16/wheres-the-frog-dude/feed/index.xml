					<description><![CDATA[The tiered nature of the Planes of Power expansion probably looked good on paper.  (That&#039;s me being nice.)  Few things were more destructive in practice however, from that ($#@*) Plane of Justice trial straight through into Time ... destructive within a guild, destructive between guilds.

More evil plots were hatched to lock other guilds out of PoP content than all previous evil plots that came before.  (Not by me or my guilds, of course.  Other. Guilds. ;)) 

Ssra wasn&#039;t bad.  Heh, was great when someone would train the Temple entrance in The Grey.  Players just running down the ramp to the door, on their last virtual breath, would run into a pile of mobs.  They&#039;d zone in at a sliver of health, bitching in /shout about who the hell trained The Grey mobs.  Or better still, bitching in /gu that they needed a rezz outside.  HAHAHA.

At least it gave the bards and clerics something to do while waiting for the rest of the guild to show up for the raids.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For what it&#039;s worth,

Ryan Palacio was the main designer in charge of the general content implementation in Lower Guk, I&#039;m not sure on the actual level design (layout) as I do know he had some help, but the other developers name currently escapes me. He went to work for Sigil (surprise, surprise) and eventually left a short time after joining. Not sure who he is employed with now, but his leave from Sigil got no press and when he joined all the news sites were all over it like flies on shit, must of been a slow news week at the time. 

Tom Wells was the mastermind behind Sebilis, last I read he was a senior designer working on the EQ2 development team. The original core designers that were responsible for most of Velious are still working at Sigil. Steve Burke (Akkirus) designed the 10th ring war and shawl quests, and implemented and designed a lot of the encounters and general concept for the overall arching story seen in the Planes of Power. I&#039;m not sure if you played through any of those encounters or not, but some of them were pretty bad ass considering EQ&#039;s limitations. Lawrence Poe (Myrlokar) designed Ssraz Temple, including a lot of the original class spells and aa abilities and is also currently employed at Sigil.

Ssraz Temple is one of my favorite zones, the layout is very zelda-esque, multiple levels and keyed off areas with traps I fuckin&#039; loved it. It would of made a kick ass grouping dungeon if tuned and itemized towards that target, I think it could have been the Sebilis zone of luclin. I don&#039;t stalk all the developers, I mainly try and familiarize myself and go out of my way to figure out who was responsible for what in the mmos I have played, which is harder than it looks if you don&#039;t have any contacts, which I don&#039;t. haha. 

J. the Yellow is far worse than me, he keeps tabs on everyone! :D]]></description>
