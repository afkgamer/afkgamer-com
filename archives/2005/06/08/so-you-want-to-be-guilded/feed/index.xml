					<description><![CDATA[Can I suggest two more?

-- Check your lists against prospective guilds. Namely /friend, /ignore, /crazy, and /ninjalooter. At the end of the day, people are going to lump you together by guild tag, whether you like it or not.

-- Related, pay attention to how leadership solves in-guild problems if you can. Ask yourself: If you were in that looting/raiding/retardedly dramatic situation, how would you feel about that outcome? Odds are if you see a response that leaves a bad taste in your mouth, another one will be along in a minute when the tag is actually over your head.]]></description>
