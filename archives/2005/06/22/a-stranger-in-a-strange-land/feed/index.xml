					<description><![CDATA[&quot;I&#039;ve been down this road before. It always starts out like this. A joke, a taunt, a throwaway idea. Next thing I know, I&#039;m back on duty in Norrath.&quot;

And now, the prophecy is complete.  Don&#039;t try to fight it.  

I can&#039;t wait to read some updates from Norrath.  You know, just for the &quot;trial&quot; of course.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[EQ2 has kept me entertained for the last couple of months. Being a hardcore EQ player back in the day(starting in December 1999), I was rather shocked at how much easier EQ2 was over EQ.

I hope you enjoy your time in EQ2land. If not, I hope you rip EQ2 to hell and gone so I can read about it and nod my head in agreement.]]></description>
