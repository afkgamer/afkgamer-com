					<description><![CDATA[If they really think there are some residuals to be had, they should stand in line with everyone else that worked on the game. I&#039;m sure their few hours in the studio is &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; comparable to the thousands of hours put in by all the worker bees. Not to mention that all the profits are going to the publisher while the developer company gets screwed over and put out of business. Did I read earlier that the scale rates are bumping from $200+ to $400+ per hour?  Sounds like pretty cushy wages to me...and if the complaint is that they only get to work a few hours and have to pay for all their down time....&quot;GET A REAL JOB&quot;, those wages are obscene.]]></description>
