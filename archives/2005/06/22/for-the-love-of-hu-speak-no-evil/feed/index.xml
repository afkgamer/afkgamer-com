					<description><![CDATA[Here is a thought: what if everyone said something like &quot;WTF go to heck all you Chinese sick governmental bureaucrats... We don&#039;t give a shit about your ban&quot; Than they could ban everyone, reducing Chinese internet to a show of made up from government propaganda and senior party bullshit dump. Perhaps than they could ban companies who say stuff and perhaps one day we might just stop communication alltogeather with them(the government not the people) plunging them(both the government and the people) into such a deep shit that they( the government not the people) might never recover. Remember, it is our economy, our technology and essentialy our internet that is keeping them alive( both the government and the people)
I only hope that Blizzard is not gonna bend over like Microsoft did. And I kinda hope I am gonna get baned from chinese internet now...:-)]]></description>
