					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;FFXI had a variety of literal bells, whistles, and horn notes&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yeah, people tear up FFXI because of the different style of gameplay but it was full of features that could be useful.  The macros were easy to make and it was great to have the  or whatever call stuck in a pull macros.  Then, you could call attention to the slackers in your group that there was something incoming.  Of course, there were morons who had calls stuck all in their macros so you had constant buzzing &#038; chirping going on.

Personally, my favorite is /thanks.  It *can* be used to thank a nice fellow player, but I like using it when I, as a 60 Warlock, smoke a 60 Horde Rogue.  I feel I should at least thank them for helping me increase my Honor point count.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I want a /wakeup

The only voice emote that would actually be useful. It happens all the time to have peoples half asleep or lagging behind. Some healthy yell would be welcome.

Blizzard should also implement a real /leroy taking the voice from the video :)]]></description>
