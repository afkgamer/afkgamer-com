					<description><![CDATA[Freeman: Yeah, I worked a ranger up to 20 and from level 14 on, absolutely no one would group with me.  They all want monks or warriors or whatever the hell else; so I had to do everything with henchmen.  It was lonely.  I decided to start up a new char and be a monk.  Now I have no trouble finding a group, but get yelled at by aggro retards who rush into a horde and are mad that I can&#039;t be their own personal bodyguard.

But I digress...

Foton&#039;s right about grouping.  In fact, I&#039;m going to have to get out of my guild here soon, too.  No one&#039;s on and when they are, they just want to do /airguitar or /dance like retards.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Some of those last PvE missions are almost impossible to do without at least one player monk, 2 preferred ... player warrior is desirable too, for the pulling (and obviously tanking).

That crystal mission, optimal group is 3 players + 3 henchmen, imo.  Almost better to have hench fill out the group cuz they follow the players instead of lolligagging around possibly aggro&#039;ing NPC stragglers.  

Bitch to do with one player until you memorize the NPC AI and time the attunements perfectly to thwart the NPCs.  2 or 3 players is ideal.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, regarding the first part of the post - we&#039;ve been grouping more and more toward the end of the game there, which consists of standing around yelling that we&#039;re looking for a group, sending tells to the few people who  say they need group members WITHOUT specifying that what they need are monks.

The last straw was a zone full of &quot;Need a monk for mission&quot;, &quot;Need 2 monks for mission&quot;, &quot;Need a monk&quot;, etc. and the real humdinger: &quot;I need a fucking monk for the mission.&quot;

So we re-rolled, as monks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&gt; Epilogue: I hired 5 NPC henchmen and finished the
&gt; mission by myself in under 15 minutes. After all, I&#039;m
&gt; not getting any younger.

Impressive.

We just couldn&#039;t do it with henchmen. We got a group and all but two people ganked NPCs (specifically, the ones carrying the crystals) while the other two delivered crystals to the right spots, which wasn&#039;t difficult.

Prior to that, we just couldn&#039;t manage that mission doing it with henchmen.]]></description>
