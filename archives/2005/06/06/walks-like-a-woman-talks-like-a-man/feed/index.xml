My friends and I thought this was pretty funny, imaging some bored employee who maybe told the intercom access code to some friends for a good laugh.

					<description><![CDATA[Is his name Damien?  I&#039;m a little rusty on my &lt;em&gt;Omen&lt;/em&gt; lore, but I think the spawn of Satan has to be staked in the heart while in a church or on other hallowed ground.

Good luck with all of that.  The fate of humanity is in your hands.]]></description>
