					<description><![CDATA[Chuckles... okay I needed that right now.  I must say I had the best and the worst group today.  I run the UW and FoW with more frequency then I care to admit.  What does this mean,  I must pick up strangers or try and get a guild group together.   I can honestly say today&#039;s group consisted of all but one stranger.  No cursing, no swearing just simply working together and using our heads for something other than a swear machine.   I don&#039;t understand the need to curse in every post or to yell at another player when ya die.  Trust me I am a monk.  I know you are dead, it happens folks.. The monsters down there are level 26 and up.  I cant heal ya for 300 points of damage which these crazy cows are dealing out .. get over it.. get out of the way.. I dont care just dont cuss me out cause you were too stupid or not fast enough to get out of the way.  And then they&#039;re are the ditchers.. leave ya out there hanging after paying the 1k entrance fee you short a man or two or heck even three.. I pay a lot cause I am working on getting supplies and stuff that I need for armor, I need help so I dont mind paying.  Oh but I digress now.. just wanted to let ya know there are good groups.  I normal ask for patient, mature players when lfg and wait.  Yes folks I wait about 5 minutes before we head out.  We&#039;ll discuss skill sets and what not in team but if you start screaming GOGOGOGOGOGOGOGO  Your outta there.  I dont mind waiting for the right group and will not leave without it.  OR what I at least hope is a good group.  I state my intentions clearly before we leave and then stick with the plan. 
  
The worst group -  took us into the FoW, before we were ready, and without the consent of the group, then agro&#039;d everything cause they didnt know what they were doing, nor would they listen to a seasoned player of both areas.  Then decided well if we die we can go out and go to the UW.  Folks if you cant hack the Fissure.. your sure as hell going to die in the Underworld.  Aint no saving your sorry asses and I&#039;ll tell ya so and leave the group.. which btw is what I did. 

Spoiled by a great guild, 
Autumn]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thats why it&#039;s nothing but henchmen for me until it&#039;s time to head into the arena. GW has basically been a 1 player game for me so far with a few levels of PVP.  I&#039;ve definitely had some shitty arena groups though, but then eventually you end up with a killer group and can blast through a couple of levels.  XP from PVP is defnitely one of the coolest things about GW.  Kind of a nice change of pace from lvl 60 war lfg ubrs, strat, schol...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmm...I&#039;ve experienced the drops but not the cussing.  Of course, when we quest or mission it&#039;s usually with the guild or the party primarily is composed of the guild.  We&#039;re pretty professional and civil.  A loser gets kicked or tongue lashed.

Why cuss?  It just takes time to type.]]></description>
