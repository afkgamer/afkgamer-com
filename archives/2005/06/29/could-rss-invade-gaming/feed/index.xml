					<description><![CDATA[Wow, this is actually a really good idea. With the recent increase of unscheduled server updates in serveral MMOGs (often the product of hasty MMOG releases- *Cough* matrix online!- as well as the general unpredictability of MMOG grown- WoW), RSS feeds could really make the system much more efficient. You should submit this post on some forums and see what response you get. By the way, I love the name of your blog!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[(eek.  Sony in da house.  Everyone act natural!)

*whistles*

Almost all of my daily web reading (return visits) are via feed reader.  I&#039;m not a tech person, but shoving as much out-of-game crap through RSS as possible would reduce the bandwidth bills.  I think.  I&#039;m guessing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Byron -- It&#039;s at http://www.eq2players.com/ ;) 

Value add character profiles, per server and global rankings, guild sites, guild chat gateway, pretty much what you describe.  No TeamSpeak, though.

The idea of using RSS to broadcast server/network info is pretty slick.  Definitely one to make a guy go &quot;Duh!&quot; indeed. :)  Hmm...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Heh, the Big MMOs haven&#039;t even caught on to simple web integration yet -- Blizzard are talking about MAYBE soon offering guild management web tools.

Where&#039;s the MMO company with the web value-add tie ins?  Character profiles, guild forums, and yes, even TeamSpeak servers!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[(Sorry about the below scribbles, but it&#039;s part of my job to increase awareness and and fundamentally that benefits both me and you.)

So, speaking of adverstising ... 

You know what&#039;s even more exciting than using RSS in gaming?  Being able to get the functionality of &#039;playing the game without playing the game&#039; while not in front of your computer.  Via a cell phone or PDA...

Sure, it&#039;s possible to get server updates -- but you can also chat back and forth between someone who&#039;s in game and someone who&#039;s on their cell phone.  In addition to a host of other features.

Clicky clicky on the site link of my name here if you want.  Froghop&#039;s the company that enables mobile access.]]></description>
