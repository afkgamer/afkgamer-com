					<description><![CDATA[There was some controversy back a few years ago on Al&#039;Kabor (the one and only Mac server) that involved a professional baseball player getting a server transfer with his level 60 character to or from the Mac server although not a single Mac user was allowed to transfer to another server nor was any PC user who now played on his or her Mac allowed to transfer a character over.

I just remember it because I thought it was pretty crappy that it could happen, but money is what makes the world go round.

(Assuming the board is still up, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eqmac.com&quot;/ rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; was where I heard about it.)&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>
