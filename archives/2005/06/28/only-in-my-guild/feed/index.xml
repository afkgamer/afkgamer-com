					<description><![CDATA[Have you ever had to /gkick someone because of stuff irl?
I was just kicked for taking up for 2 guildies who got kicked because they informed the leaders that they would be in and out of the game irregularly for the next 4 months while they made plans for their upcomming wedding. The leaders said that would be a &#039;hindrence and detrimental to the health of the guild&#039;, a guild with more than 70 level 60s. Which really is utter bs cause having 2 less mouths to feed just makes it easier for MC/Ony runs. 
Talk about guild comradery. ;( All I was trying to point out was you dont kick guildies for getting married,you support them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[best things that happened to me:

1. One person coming down with Lung cancer (was never able to verify but he returned 6 months later and had pictures of himself without hair, so maybe even true)

2. One guy ending up in a car accident and the first thing he asked his brother to do on the mobile was come online and tell us (his guild) that he won&#039;t be around for a bit...

3. a Female guildie running off mid-raid because &quot;the baby is coming&quot; (true)

3b. her husband logging on 40 minutes later asking where she is, before running off to the hospital after we told him.

2 is what i call dedication, a married couple that uses  guildchat for relaying of messages should maybe see a counsellor (mobile phones have been invented for a while :p)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love the shot self in leg story.

Everyone&#039;s witnessed the miraculous cancer recoveries of MMOG players.  It&#039;s so prevalent, I&#039;m wondering if there&#039;s some sort of direct connection between gaming and cancer cures.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Speaking of hardcore players, when I was a guide in EQ back in the day I answered a petition that had been in the queue for over an hour.

The guy who sent the petition had died in sol b and wanted me to get his corpse for him because his wife was in labor and he couldn&#039;t wait much longer to drive her to the hospital.

I just had this vision of his wife in the background screaming and him saying, &quot;Hold on just a bit longer, I don&#039;t want to lose my corpse!&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had both B and C happen in my gaming circles, once each.  The person in question from B is out and playing again... I never did ask.  Neither were in my guild at the time -- it was on a MUD with a playerbase of about 100 active.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had a guildie who miraculously returned from the dead.  She stopped playing one day and someone logged onto her account to tell the guild that she had accidentally shot herself and had passed on.  Apparently she owned a ranch in Australia or something.

About 6 months later she showed back up and told us that she had indeed shot herself but it was in the leg and that she was laid up for a while.

Ya...whatever.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve seen the infidelity with guildmates, not the accidental pregnancy, however.  (yet)

Parapalegics (not a quad), ya.  Drunk, foul-mouthed parapalegic that we met in a bar at a Fan Faire.  But that&#039;s another story entirely.

Was that bartender from Texas?  Cuz I might know that guy.]]></description>
