					<description><![CDATA[From the screenshots it looked like he was playing a monk and only made it to level 8 or something.  I love my monk, but that&#039;s because I am used to being a support char.  He&#039;s entitled to his opinion, but I think there&#039;s a reason why he found it boring.]]></description>
