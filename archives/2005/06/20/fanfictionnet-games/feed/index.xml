Oh dear.

Oh well if you can&#039;t beat them, join them.

AfkGamer: The Joining
Once upon a time on a cold and wintery night...
... &quot;You have to find all five missing pieces of the Line of Url before you can enter the portal.&quot; said the tavern keeper. &quot;Oh, and I have this rat infestantion in my celler&quot;...
...&quot;That&#039;s ok baby, I can fix that problem of not having any night elf in you.&quot; Foton proclaimed as he removed his tunic...
... &quot;What? The Portal isn&#039;t in this castle?&quot;....
... &quot;You will die, Lum!&quot; yelled Foton as he drew his +5 damage rapier with water and fire resists....
... and so it ended happily ever after.

Oh man I&#039;m going to win a nobel for this one..]]></description>
