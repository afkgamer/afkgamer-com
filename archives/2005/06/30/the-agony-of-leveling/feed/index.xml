					<description><![CDATA[Roleplaying is for winky dinks? Personally, I like roleplaying, which is why I&#039;m into Neverwinter nights. Sure, in NWN, a good game takes longer to find, because you&#039;ve got to go to the forums, post, etc.. But once you find a game (I prefer a DMed one for better roleplaying, in those ones you actually get XP for posting character backstories, good roleplaying during and outside of fights, etc..), its alot of fun. If you&#039;re not that much into roleplaying, maybe you prefer a &quot;roleplaying lite&quot; experience, then a good game is even easier to find. Its not nearly as convenient as an MMO, where you just log in whenever you want, find some ppl and start bashing monsters together, but what&#039;s convenient isn&#039;t always what&#039;s best. In the words of Heid from that 70&#039;s show: &quot;If it were, this frozen pizza wouldn&#039;t taste like monkey butt&quot;, or Kitty: &quot;If it were, I would just wear a moomoo and eat out of a can!&quot;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hear you, Brian.  I did a free trial for a month about a year ago.  I ended up spending about 12 hours a day on it (more on the weekends) for a month straight.  It&#039;s the most addictive thing I&#039;ve ever tried.  At the end of the month I looked at what I had to show for all that time:  a little, poorly dressed figure on a screen.  At the time part of me loved it but part of me was disgusted with myself.  In hindsight, it&#039;s one month of my life I&#039;ll never see again.  I&#039;m just glad my trial was up.  I don&#039;t know if I could have broken free otherwise.

Even 1 year later I&#039;m still drawn to it.  That&#039;s why when I saw a link to this blog I had to follow it.  Anyway, I&#039;m not going to say you guys are all losers and should quit playing these games.  But really, what&#039;s the point of being alive if you&#039;re not going to live?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If it&#039;s just a pain in the ass to play these games then why the hell play them?  What is the fun in doing all those things you just mentioned?  This doesn&#039;t sound like a game aka fun thing.  It sounds more like work aka not a fun thing.

Stop spending money for frustration to morons like Verant who&#039;s only interest is making money.  Remember, these companies &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; you to take 8 year to level.  The longer it takes, the more months you give over your money to them.

I can think of a mess of other things I&#039;d put the $15 or whatever it costs a month to play an average MMOG these days.  Like maybe food, or bath supplies.

BTW, if I seem strong in the wording here please don&#039;t take personal offense.  I&#039;ve seen EQ nearly destroy a marrage and watched my sister turn into a recluse over EQ.  Games like this are utterly evil in my opinion.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In no other game are these well-stated points more evident and NEEDED than FFXI.

Since grouping and partying is just about a requirement after level 15, unless you have a steady group of friends that are of the same mindset (I dont quite agree with the &quot;sharing is for kids&quot; point), you can plan on spending at least 30 minutes LFG, followed by 15 minutes waiting for other members to get to the gathering spot, followed by 15 minutes arguing over the best camp, another 10 deciding what mob is best to fight, 10 more arguing over why no one has food or the correct equipment, etc ad nauseaum, until you finally, after about 90 minutes from your original LFG time, you finally fight a mob.

Sigh.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I totally know how this feels. I need a quarter of a bar to hit 47 in ROSE Online right now, just so I can catch up with a friend of mine I&#039;ve been competing with.

...Damnit, why am I wasting time writing this comment?]]></description>
