					<description><![CDATA[Responding to #7 Tranixx&#039;s comment - the meeting stone functionality is partially in the game now.  If you&#039;re lucky, you can quickly click on a small button that appears on the right edge of your minimap when you log in.  When you do, a message comes up about leaving the meeting stone queue or something like that.  Since that much is in already, maybe it&#039;ll be up and running &quot;officially&quot; in the next content patch (once can hope).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think the people who try to buy time start off with a /who 60 and ask everyone in the list, then a /who 59 and so on until they find some sucker. I do know that when I reached 60, the number of begging requests increased at least threefold. At first, I would ask for the name of their guild leader and then talk to him or send him a mail explaining that he had a begging scumbag in his guild and suggesting that he might want to take action. Unfortunately, everyone in warcraft is guilded, if you are not, then you can expect to get invites so often it feels like a harassment violation. I have no doubt these people just move on to the next guild whose members have  macros. I can be a pretty cruel person, but I dont think my next plan of action was undeserved. Now adays, I agree to help nooberX with whatever boss he needs to kill and tell him to meet me at the entrance to the instance and to message me when they get there. I make this sound as genuine as possible. Then I put them on ignore and think about how many times they were killed trying to get to the portal. To give you an idea of what I could of won if I actually turned up, $10 for killing Vancleef, $200 to powerlevel from 26-40, $40 for that 15% drop rate 1handed sword from the hydra at the bottom of blackfathom deeps, $10 for the four bosskills in SM to complete the quest.

Take a closer look at who hangs around outside the ironforge bank. You should see a good number of level 60s, further investigation will also reveal another small congregation right outside the ironforge gate that are dueling each other.
Now, I am a freak. I am the only level 60 player on alliance on my server that doesnt belong to a guild. I will be joining my long time guild on the Euro servers when it finally gets released here in a few weeks, so I have no intention of joining a &#039;pickup guild&#039; in the interim.
My class is not part of the holy trilogy, so groups are pretty hard to get. I have a few friends who try to hook me up when their guild raid needs one more person, but in general I am stuck with pickup groups. Actually its worse than that, I am now stuck with pickup raids. There is a complete lack of of any global &quot;looking for group&quot; functionality, its not even possible to tell if someone is in a group so sending /tells to people asking them to join me will yield pretty poor results. At level 60, theres basically just three things people do:
1. Group up and do instance runs.
2. Player vs Player
3. Port back to ironforge to repair, sell their junk and check on their auctions.
Two of these are busytime. The only way to form pickup groups is hanging around in ironforge and using the general or lfg channels or talking directly to the other level 60s who are hanging around or between instance runs.

Expect this problem to get a lot worse as more people reach level 60. See, there is nothing you can do without a large group. Hopefully blizzard has recognised this problem, there is talk of &quot;meeting stones&quot; and other such systems. This isn&#039;t going to solve the underlying issue, it will just move these congregations outside of IF to wherever the meeting stones are. The fundamental problem will still remain, theres nothing to do at level 60 that doesn&#039;t require a lot of people and a lot of time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ah, buyouts.  wth is with people that don&#039;t put buyouts on their non-blue/purple stuff?  If you&#039;re selling a green item better than the one I have, I want it now!  Not maybe 12 hours later (screw your &#039;very long&#039; auction, I ain&#039;t waiting for it).

Put a reasonable buyout on your unwanted shit, and if I like it i&#039;ll gladly give you the money for the convienience of getting back to what I really want to do (killing and such, the point of the gear in the first place).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[heh, love the asshat rating system.  I think I have quite a few that are just a 1 rating, but can&#039;t recall the circumstances leading up to the /ignore.

					<description><![CDATA[What would be handy would be an asshats out of 10 rating for those on your ignore list - kind of like when your containers fill up and you dump the least valuable loot, you could remove people with lower asshat ratings.

From 1 asshat out of 10 (I was extremely drunk and didn&#039;t mean to add you to /ignore) to 10 asshats out of 10 (I would need to be extremely drunk to take you off /ignore).

Because hitting the limit when there are still so many to ignore isn&#039;t much good.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s some kind of line regarding equipment.  It&#039;s not worth whoring yourself completely to have The Best Equipment, or doing runs way below your level in the hope that you get the rare uber-drop (which some other party member will probably get the lucky roll on anyway).  

So long as you make some effort to have gear that&#039;s Pretty Good, which is easy enough if you&#039;re got a semi-useful craft, then you can buy plenty of decent stuff.

On the other hand it pays to do some research into the potential of stuff your level, otherwise you can hitting way under your weight in a group, and end up on The List for sucking.

Speaking of, why don&#039;t you just put the casino people and all their damn shills on ignore?]]></description>
