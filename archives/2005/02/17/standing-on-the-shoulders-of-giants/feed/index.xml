					<description><![CDATA[EQ2 is a great game. WoW is a great game. Both are really, really good. Now, EQ2 has no PvP and it is group oriented, but they are working to smooth that out a bit. Yesterday&#039;s patch included a ton of solo instance content. Don&#039;t dismiss it out of hand. I don&#039;t think any reasonable gamer would say it isn&#039;t seductive, once you&#039;ve played it (and I mean, play it past that newbie isle thing and get into Freeport and start doing evil stuff for The Man).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[From what I&#039;ve read (haven&#039;t tried myself), EQ2 isn&#039;t (not sure of word here) seductive (?) enough to pull off a gamer kill.  

But I will lay down some money that this story will take over where the WoW warrior protest left off.  Not quite a day later and /pizza is all over the WoW boards.]]></description>
