					<description><![CDATA[Honestly, I&#039;m not sure what direction Vanguard is headed in and I have been following the pre-development for over a year now. They have all ready announced a few dumbed-down game mechanics like the silvery cord. The mechanic that leads you via a cord to X point, etc. That doesn&#039;t sound very hardcore at all.

I guess a fair assumption would be a middleground of sorts with more of a focus on group interdependency than solo play. I guess you could consider it a direct opposite of WoW, but not more punitive than EQ. Whenever someone brings up the question if the game will have solo content or not, Brad usually replies, &quot;there will be casual content, more on this later.&quot; Casual content? Vague as all hell. 

The game will most likely require a longer time investment to reach the cap than WoW and offer a few more robust systems, like crafting-harvesting but, I don&#039;t think it will be hardcore like EQ was pre-Velious. So far, there really is nothing new or innovative on paper. The dynamisms and advanced spawning-flag systems that are planned have been done in numerous games before. I think a lot of the combat mechanics will be based on DAOC&#039;s system, we might see group skill chains like FFXI, the spawning system will borrow concepts from UO and SWG. We will know more when E3 rolls around. It&#039;s a 30 million dollar investment with the potential of cross development platform for the Xbox folks, I don&#039;t think they can make it too niche for the hardcores. 

Probably the #1 thing that I&#039;m looking forward too, is the overall potential, being the fanboi I am, I like Sigil&#039;s team of developers. Kendrick, Akkirus, Tagad, Aradune, Myrlokar, etc. I know what these guys are capable of from a pve persperctive, so it will be interesting to see what they come up with, even if it&#039;s nothing revolutionary in a different shiny. I think the game will definitely lack easter egg type humor though, to preserve their high-yawn-fantasy setting. Honestly, from a game vs game perspective, D&#038;D online sounds much more interesting to me right now. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fair warning about Vanguard - from what I&#039;ve heard, it&#039;ll be even more punitive than the original EQ was, regarding death, damage and the like.
