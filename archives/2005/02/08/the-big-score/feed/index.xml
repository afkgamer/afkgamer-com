					<description><![CDATA[Well.  I assigned this ethical discussion to my imaginary intern.  And I think we all know how interns are, especially the imaginary variety.  So it may never get written.

Suffice to say, much as I enjoy a cloak of anonymity, (as most of us in gaming do), I think my subjects should enjoy the same privacy, particularly when I skewer them mercilessly.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d say it&#039;s likely this one as it&#039;s the only high lvl non-bind on pickup that a rogue couldn&#039;t use with a proc that could be described as vicious.  http://thottbot.com/index.cgi?i=14001 

It&#039;s listed as only dropping in an instance but the comments show otherwise.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[jafd, you raise some interesting points.  Other than the I&#039;m full of myself, which I am ... quite often.  So I&#039;ll concede that point up front.

As the login servers are down AT THE MOMENT, just when I was swapping back to the main character, I read your provocative comment, and I&#039;d like to respond.  Tomorrow, I&#039;ll make a mini-post in response as some of the issues you raise require more space than a flippant response.]]></description>
