	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Yesterday, I mentioned in passing that there was a minor incident, a week or two ago, involving a Warcraft item auction of mine.  Actually, the surrounding mayhem over this auction grew to such proportions, it was like I had looted a national treasure instead of an epic weapon.  </p>
<p>Unlike a lot of epic items in this game, this bitch was the real deal:  nice stats, great DPS, a vicious proc and hella fast.  Ohh, if only my toon could have used it, I&#8217;d be a god now.</p>
<p>The setup:  Running through one of the higher zones, on my way to somewhere else, I ran into this named mob.  By that, I mean I actually ran over him and his four goons.  Since I know well enough the pain of killing a named, only to die seconds later and lose out on any possible phatness, as soon as Mr. Named hit the dirt, I power-looted him &#8212; the ole shift+right-click, which autodrains a corpse of all its items.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s kind of my specialty, loot whore that I am.</p>
<p>In the text box, I see a purple name fly by.  (Weeeee, phatness tonight!!)  Eventually, I killed the remaining goons, and began hunting around in my bags to see if the phat was hot or not.  And goddamn, I said GODDAMN, that bitch was hot.  </p>
<p>Naturally, I boasted in /guildchat &#8230; we oooed and ahhhed &#8230; we raced to <a href="http://thottbot.com/">thottbot</a> to see how it stacked up against other weapons &#8230; more oooo&#8217;s, more ahhh&#8217;s.  A couple of the guildies tried to lay claim, announcing their intention to respec weapon skills to accommodate this virtual fineness.  As if.  </p>
<p>&#8220;And no, you can&#8217;t roll up a tank alt right now and lay claim either.&#8221;  Fuckers.</p>
<p><span id="more-265"></span>So, we finished up our hunting for the night, I stoned back to Ironforge, and slapped the newfound phatness up in an auction:  24 hours, high minimum bid, no buyout.  Read it and weep, losers.  Gotta want it.</p>
<p>I logged.  I slept.  I worked.  I logged in &#8230; with 10 plus emails in my game mailbox.  What.  the.  fuck.  </p>
<p>Y&#8217;see, I had never done an auction of this magnitude before and I foolishly listed the auction with my main character instead of an alt, which means I was to have no peace and quiet until the auction was done.  Lesson learned.</p>
<p>Some of the emails asked where I had looted the weapon.  (*Delete*  Ya, I&#8217;m going to tell people where I got it.  I don&#8217;t think so.)  Others offered 150 gold to 250 gold if I&#8217;d pull the auction.  ???  The fucking bid was at 500 gold within minutes of listing, so unless these people were illiterate, they might want to stop smoking so much crack.</p>
<p>And I said as much in my replies &#8212; more politely, of course.  </p>
<p>Moments after sending out those replies, the <a href="https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/archives/2005/02/07/ding-now-what/">guildleader of the farm guild</a> sends a tell something like, &#8220;oh, I thought you were Chinese.  hehe.&#8221;  Because only the Chinese get purple loot?  What the hell was that?  My toon name isn&#8217;t even remotely Chinese-like, so who knows what the fuck he was thinking.  Anyway.</p>
<p>Again, he offered 250 gold.  Again, I explained that the bid was at 600 gold-plus and if he wanted the item, use &#8230; the &#8230; Auction &#8230; House, and I moved on to answering other tells and accepting congratulations on such a fine score.</p>
<p>He persisted, claiming the weapon wasn&#8217;t worth NEARLY 600 gold.  What-fucking-ever, at least three bidders disagreed with him on that point, so why wasn&#8217;t he shutting up already.</p>
<p>I tired of watching the bid spiral upward so I griffed the hell away from Ironforge and worked on some quests.  Well, as best I could, as I continued to get tells for the next four hours with various offers and questions.  </p>
<p>About an hour before auction close, Farm Guild leader and his minions started sending tells again in earnest.  They&#8217;ve pooled their gold, their main tank really needs this to be viable (I care?), everybody knows it&#8217;s overpriced, I should take this lower offer and run, Ironforge is abuzz with what a ripoff that auction is (again, I care?), blah blah.  </p>
<p>I figured they were getting downright insulting, so I told the guildleader it was just this simple:  put up or shut up.  And if he couldn&#8217;t shut up, I could make him shut up.  So I did.  With /ignore.</p>
<p>The auction closed soon thereafter, at 750 gold (ka-ching!), and as I learned in tell from the buyer, it went to a 60 paladin from a tiny guild, not unlike my own.  He was only able to afford it because everyone pooled their gold so he could have the uber.  Which was nice.  I&#8217;m glad it found a nice home where it will be treasured as it should.  So to speak.</p>
<p>The next night, a guildie said that Farm Guild leader wanted off my ignore because he was curious how much the uber had gone for and to whom.</p>
<p>Various evil replies sprang to mind:  &#8220;I disenchanted it&#8221;, &#8220;I gave it to a noob pally in Goldshire&#8221;, &#8220;I had to sell privately for 100 gold to a hunter&#8221;, and the classic &#8230; &#8220;fuck off.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Ultimately, I declined to respond; I&#8217;d had enough of his bullshit to last me quite a while.  </p>
<p>I did answer one of his guildmates, however, when they asked where I had looted the big score.  I almost felt a little guilty about lying, when I saw that a group of them was scouring Badlands the next night.</p>
<p>I wonder how that worked out for them.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>and since Foton&#8217;s main toon is a rogue, I&#8217;d assume that it is a 2H Mace, Axe, or Sword. A nice one with stats and fast speed is the Blade of Hanna, but no proc. So really, I&#8217;m just flipping through thott asking &#8220;WTH did Foton pull&#8230;&#8221;</p>
