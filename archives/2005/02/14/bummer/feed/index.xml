					<description><![CDATA[The higher commission in The neutral auction house was put in, by demand of the beta players who feared that no one would ever use the normal auction houses again (probably the most stupid argument i ever heard, because i always pass through ironforge each day, but almost never venture into Tanaris anymore...).
I don&#039;t like it either, but thats the way it is...
Concerning the lost mails, that really is annoying, but the thing annoying me more is the stupid first GM.
He can without problems restore the Gold (happened to me twice, no problems fixing it via a petition), personally i&#039;d report that GM..

Concerning the CoD Bug, well whoever uses CoD outside of his guild is pretty naive anyway...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ya, I can make up a backstory to cover just about anything, too.  

This is in addition to the deposits required for an auction, which are stated upfront.  This was &quot;I don&#039;t know what the hell that charge was for but it was alot.&quot;]]></description>
