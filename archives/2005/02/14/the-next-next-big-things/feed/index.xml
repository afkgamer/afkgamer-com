					<description><![CDATA[LOL, Erkht!  I&#039;ve never heard of the jump rule as a pass/fail item.  But, you&#039;re right.  It is damn annoying.  I tried Guild Wars for an hour or two.  It has some nice ideas, like how you can invite an NPC to fight in your group to fill in a role that is currently absent from your group.  Other than that, I was throughly bored and I uninstalled it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I tried Guild Wars, for all of 10 minutes.. It failed my number one test for a fun game, as did SWG: There is no way to make your character jump.  In SWG you can jump, but it&#039;s just an emote.. Always annoyed the hell outta me.. 80 gajillion dollars to develop this cutting edge *3D* world, and you can&#039;t jump over a 6 inch freaking curb.. WTF!?! So ya, Guild Wars, studied all the keybindings, no jump. Ran to the top of a very small (15 feet?) hillock, and couldn&#039;t jump off or run down it!! LAME!  If I want good 2D gameplay, I&#039;ll just go back to UO or D2..]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Aye, that&#039;s what the word on the street is about Guild Wars - no monthly fees.  There are also some ex-Blizzard folks working at Arena Net (the company behind it), if that means anything to anyone.  Since I haven&#039;t played any of the free trials or betas, dunno how &quot;fun&quot; it actually is.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Aren&#039;t they planning no monthly fees for Guild Wars? I thought they were planning on charging for additional content (expansions). If so, Guild Wars definitely looks interesting. I love the idea of MMOGs but I still can&#039;t come to terms with the monthly fees. If GW doesn&#039;t charge them, I would definitely give it a try.]]></description>
