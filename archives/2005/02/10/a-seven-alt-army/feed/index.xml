					<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;also of note is that blizzard thought it would be hilarious to slap a lvl 35 tag on him when he&#039;s actualy a 50 to 55 (spawns within that range).&lt;/i&gt;

Either he isn&#039;t 50, or my Paladin is godlike - I beat him several times as a Paladin while I was in the 42-46 level range. (with, naturally, 5 or 10 level 25&#039;s beating on him from behind.)  He&#039;s tough for 35, but not *that* tough.

Funny story, though. :)]]></description>
