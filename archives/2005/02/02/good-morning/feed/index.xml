					<description><![CDATA[My guess is the chests.  Several camps only a short pony ride apart that spawn chests.

EDIT:  this particular STV camper is almost always in STV and the few times I ran across him/her while I was questing there, he/she was working the chest circuit.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Azshara I can understand, its got lots of 50+ mobs and nobody really goes there. Sure, the thunderhead farming got nerfed, but I can still imagine theres some good stuff there. Pretty much everyone 50+ who isnt in an instance uses plaguelands to grind because of the argent dawn faction benifits.

But STV, whats up with that? As far as I recall, the mobs there dont go beyond about level 40. Any idea what the attraction is?]]></description>
