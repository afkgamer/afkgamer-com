					<description><![CDATA[Yes, 2-box requires 2 separate WoW accounts.  (How to explain this properly ...)

Paying for 2 accounts for a game is the least of our expenses.  Each new game requires boosting the gaming machine, etc. etc., so most of the gamers I know just assume that at least two accounts will be required for each game.

Now that I read that, it sounds crazy.

EDIT:  (still trying to justify myself) ... It&#039;s not just a matter of &quot;not sharing&quot;, it&#039;s also, waiting around for enough priests to log in, enough tanks, do we have the DPS, how bout some crowd control (mages), etc.  In sum, are we self-sufficient?  

You cannot know pain until you&#039;ve sat on your ass in the virtual town, hoping that Joe Dumbumpriest logs in.  If you had any sense at all, you&#039;d hope he wasn&#039;t going to play that night, and yet ... there you are, hoping that he will.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In terms of two-boxing it... would you also have to have two distinct accounts each?  That&#039;s a lot of cash to fork over to not have to split loot :)]]></description>

Of course this is best done when there are no GM&#039;s around.]]></description>
