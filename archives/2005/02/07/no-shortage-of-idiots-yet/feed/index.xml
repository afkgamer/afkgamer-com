					<description><![CDATA[Ok.  But if your game&#039;s death penalty is so punitive, I&#039;m going to have to REALLY LOVE your game to keep playing.  I mean true love.

Maybe others have loved a game that much, not me.  Yet.  

I like WoW a great deal, but I&#039;m still on the fence about the level 60 content.  I&#039;m not sure I would have continued if WoW had (in my perception) a punitive death penalty.  Maybe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d have to disagree with your post here. Losing gold instead of XP is ridiculous in terms of role playing. As a developer... I think people need to quit focusing on leveling up and enjoy the virtual world. Just playing for your next level is a waste of time. Dying needs to be a horific experience....you should be trying to keep from dying at all costs. If you have ever played tabletop D&amp;D, you get a much worse penalty when you die, you have to create a brand new character and start all over again. I think losing whatever XP you have accumulated since your last &quot;ding&quot; is a much better option.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like the AO way of doing death, you can never loose a level, and the xp you loose is just put into debt, and you get it back at 2:1 for every following xp point earned. And there is a class &#039;spell&#039; that increases the xp regain at nearly 3 times this speed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I popped into FFXI last week because I hadn&#039;t for a while, and did a little bit of hunting, a little shopping, and a little questing.

Then I went out for a quick money trip, grabbing fire crystals to put up for auction. During this trip, I pop over a level. I wasn&#039;t even really expecting it, so I was happy about it. Soon after I&#039;m kneeling down to heal and an orc &quot;notices&quot; me. The &quot;teacher!!&quot; kind of noticing. Once he was done with me, I was dead, and had lost a level. I just popped on for fun, but that one act basically negated over an hour and half&#039;s worth of entertainment and soured me (again) on playing the game.

feh. feh on level loss. CoH and WoW both have it right.]]></description>
