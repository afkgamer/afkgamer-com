					<description><![CDATA[G_RAM and Graham is the same dude, i just forgot what i had posted as before.  Also i have never scammed and i dont like scamers.  As noted in the first post.  But apparently reading isnt your thing.  

The fact that you cant see the differnce between beliving you should be free to do something and still thinking it is wrong shows how weak your cognitive skills are.

&quot;So I guess the answer to go with your fucked up view is to not deal with anyone outside those you know?&quot;

I would say that pretty much sums it up.  But also anyone that was recommend to me by some one else respectable.  But if i have no idea who you are, i have no reason to trust you so i will prolly not buy from you.  I mean when you buy a TV you dont buy it from some random dude in a back alley.  Same thing goes for goods and services provided in game.  Go to respectable dealer and you wont get burned.

If you fall for a scam it is your fault.  If you whine to a GM, your stupidity has now taken away your cash/item and time from a GM that could have been spent on a real issue.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow.  We got a couple of scammers posting to your Blog Foton!  Who else but a scammer would bash the victim.  I mean how is it the players fault?  ScamsAlot advertises a high end Enchantment...you put your item to be enchanted in the non-trade box and pay the man then he does a lower enchantment.  

You guys are on crack if you think that is the player&#039;s fault.  Who in their right mind would enchant an item without payment first?  You do that then the enchanter gets scammed by doing enchantments for free.  So I guess the answer to go with your fucked up view is to not deal with anyone outside those you know?  You two are fucked up plain and simple.

The GMs are there to insure the playability of the game.  Assholes like ScamsAlot ruin that for the rest of us honest people.  I personally have never been scammed but it enrages me that 2 scammers like G_RAM and Graham would have the stupidity to try and blame the victim.

I think the scammer should be banned permanently and they should flag his CC# so that he can&#039;t get another account.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Its not the scammers who waste GM time, if anything you should be suspended for making spurious petitions.  That would learn em fast enough i am sure.  That and getting burned by the scam.

But i can just see the PR nightmare that would be too.  It will never happend but i can dream i suppose.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s all true.  But the hosebags consume a huge portion of an already overworked CS staff&#039;s time and attention.  Kinda like the 20/80 principle, except with gaming, I&#039;d bet it&#039;s more like 5% of the people cause 95% of the problems and complaints.

Just ban him.  Poof, number of petitions filed drop immediately.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Are GM&#039;s there to protect people from there own stupidity?  I dont scam people and i dont like people who do.  But christ.  Go play a single player game if you arnt willing to deal with people and all there various natures.  Its not hard to avoid scams.
