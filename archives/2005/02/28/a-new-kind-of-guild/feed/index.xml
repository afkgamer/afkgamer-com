					<description><![CDATA[I have already contemplated this sort of feature. I&#039;ve checked out the Combat Stats app for EQ2 (not that useful, but these types of apps are interesting nonetheless) and it monitors what is dumped to file via the /log cmd. This dumps text to a file, and Combat Stats intelligently parses the text to regurgitate back some stats by doing some simple math and such.

It would not be hard to parse the same file triggering off of key words in a guild chat or group chat that trigger it to blog something. Heck, you could even have it monitor for new screenshot files to embed them in the blogged text.

This would be like having an embeded news reporter on the frontlines... but we&#039;d become innondated by countless gammer&#039;s blogs with useless &quot;I saw the named Gnoll of Uberville today, I pooped myself because he was a Heroic encounter and sadly today... I am flying solo.&quot; accompanied by a screenshot or 30 of this great day in history. While cool, I dunno if this would have much appeal for anyone other than yourself, your guildmates, and perhaps a handful of friends... but it might still be something that&#039;d be quite popular.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Eventually, blogging could become so ingrained in that guild&#039;s culture, they may never accomplish anything in game. Everyone would be alt-tabbed out of game to blog everything.&quot;

Consider the results if they all have two monitors. And/or, a microphone hooked into a speech-to-text program. Live! From the front!

Chilling, really.]]></description>
