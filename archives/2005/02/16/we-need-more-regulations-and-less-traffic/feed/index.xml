					<description><![CDATA[Here are a few fun facts about game companies:

- If the game company is based in Japan, you can access their quarterly info on their websites (usually).  I don&#039;t know the complete details, but apparently there are some Japanese laws that require that they report in this matter, so it&#039;s easier to find sales numbers from Nintendo, Sony, Konami, Capcom and the like than Take Two or the Microsoft gaming division.

- Sell-in vs. sell-thru - keep this in mind whenever you read a press release.  Companies often like to obscure the sales numbers in this way by mentioning that a game has sold X million copies, but this often means &quot;sold to retailers to stock in their warehouses and shelves&quot; - i.e. sell-in.  Sell thru actually means &quot;in the customers&#039; hands.&quot;

- Like Factory said above me, if the company is public, they&#039;re obligated to their shareholders and misleading them about how the company is performing is asking for trouble.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While it&#039;s not an audit, anything a company releases to shareholders would, I presume, have to be 100% correct, or they would be in a bit of legal trouble. (of course, that never stopped Enron, and they do not have to say everything about the company)]]></description>
