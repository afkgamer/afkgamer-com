					<description><![CDATA[you can also set a key-bind to your preferred curing key with CTra and then it automatically targets and casts for you ;)

playing a mage, a priest and a pala myself i&#039;d probably miss my decursive, but we managed kazzak before it was around so i think we can manage again...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[ct raidassist makes it easy to see when someone in a raid gets a debuff, and uses a different color to highlight them depending on the type. which is very useful. but you still need to target and cast by yourself, so i&#039;m sure they&#039;ll still allow somethin like that. and unless you&#039;re way slow, you can always target the next person before the cooldown on the spell is done anyways... so its a non-issue, but you actually do have to play.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Way to pimp the best australian pc mag!

Yeah, as a druid, no moer decursive is going to make me cry, time to watch entire parties die as I tab threw looking for why people are losing hundreds of health, or forgetting to remove a few that do 4k+ damage after 60 seconds.

go blizz go!]]></description>
