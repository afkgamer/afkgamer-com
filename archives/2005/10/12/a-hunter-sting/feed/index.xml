					<description><![CDATA[My guess, with absolutely no information?

Farming the bosses for disenchant loot.

A high level hunter can take on some pretty nasty baddies, one on one- and Mauradon has just that, in areas that a smart hunter could easily get to with the proper use of feign death- the Mauradon patrols aren&#039;t too bad, and the static groups all have a bit of space between them.

If I remember correctly, all the bosses in that second section (Landslide, Princess, the Croc, and some named goblin) are single enemy fights- if you&#039;ve done the hunter epic quest, you&#039;ve sucessfully fought level 60 elites with no assistance, so that shouldn&#039;t be a problem.  Any of the blue loot disenchants into small brilliant shards, with some cash besides.  Check the auction house- if those guys have large lots of small brilliant shards for sale, they likely got them while this was going on.]]></description>
