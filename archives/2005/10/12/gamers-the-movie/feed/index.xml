					<description><![CDATA[When you hire your people, let me know, maybe we can split the cost? 

By the way some of the cast and crew of &quot;Gamers&quot; will be showing up at Gen Con in Anaheim, CA. November 18th, 3PM-6PM and November 19th, 4PM -7PM.
On Saturday, November 19th, we will be showing up with William Katt, Michael Bell and Dave Hanson.


We will more than likely be showing on both days either a ton of clips or a &quot;Pre-Festival edit&quot; of the film, so we can see if anyone laughs at all and make some slight changes.

We&#039;ve entered the movie into Sundance, Slamdance, Berlin, Santa Barbara, Palm Springs, South-by-Southwest, and HBO Comedy Festival. 

We are out of marketing money, so I thought I&#039;d come to your web site to spread the word. Thanks for allowing me to whore the movie here.

And of course, anyone who mentions your site, will get some special free &quot;stuff&quot;.

Take Care and Thanks,
Chris

P.S.
Send me an email and we&#039;ll post a link to your site on our web page.]]></description>
