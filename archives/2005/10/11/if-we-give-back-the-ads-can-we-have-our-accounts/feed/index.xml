					<description><![CDATA[I know your problem, man.  Sucks.  I&#039;ll spare you the lecture of how in the old days, we didn&#039;t have your fancy schmancy ...

Site gets popular, owner has to pay the bills somehow.  Billions of ads popping over and under and sideways, load ads, stupid clickables etc etc, imo, renders a game site WORTHLESS.  (I&#039;m looking in your direction too, Gamespot.)  

Site owners do have choices on the amount and tenor of the ads on their sites.  They make poor choices, I won&#039;t be back.  Unless they&#039;re offering Free! Game Gold! to all visitors, they can&#039;t possibly have anything I need.

I used to go to Allakawhatsit back in the EQ Planes of Power days almost every day to see what new drops had been discovered.  Site started slowing to a crawl, (the ads never slowed down, however) and I was having problems with spyware mysteriously showing up every day ... and that was the end of my visits to Allahkazems.

Plus, it&#039;s hard to spell.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Okay, if Alla is a sty, where am I supposed to get accurate drop rates?  (Of course, based on taking nine trips to Wailing last weekend for a 25% drop item, I&#039;m not sure Alla&#039;s at all accurate on that anymore.)

And don&#039;t say Thottbot, &#039;cause if you try to find a drop rate on that, you get eight different versions of the mob, and I don&#039;t like trying to do hard statistics in my head.

I&#039;m looking for big numbers of kills (to improve accuracy and all that) and intelligent consolidation of logged kills.]]></description>
