					<description><![CDATA[I find it truly pathetic that any guild would force a respec on a player.

&quot;Guild Management&quot; as you refer to it:  Just another player that paid $50 for the game and subscribes to the service just like anyone else.  Any guild that REQUESTS a particular spec should at the very least pay for the respec into and out of whatever talent pool they want for an instance.

Secondly, if you think moonkin doesn&#039;t do well in instances... you are wrong, there are plenty of video&#039;s to be found via your nearest search engine.

You want a build -- REQUEST it, dont mandate it.  Almost any build can function, albeit not the uberleet build you may try to force on someone that is paying just as much for a game as you are.

And to those players that find themselves in the unfortunate circumstance of joining a guild that wants to control your playstyle -- /gquit and find another.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hehe i know that druid problem :D
we have 2 die-hard PvE druids who will not respec, but the other 6 are going feral or balance now.
Our officers have for now decided that any druid found in catform while ANY member of the raid dies will get -dkp and serious healers (holy/disc priests, restoration druids hell palas in healing gear ffs) get first dibs on the slots.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, my druid is only at level 20, so I&#039;m no where near being able to actually &lt;em&gt;become&lt;/em&gt; the Moonkin, so it makes even less sense for me.  Come on, though, doesn&#039;t your guild realize how awesome it&#039;d be to have whole parties of Moonkin?  Dancing?  Dancing, I tell you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think all our guild druids picked up moonkin form cuz of the cute factor.  They have been ordered, however, to &quot;repair&quot; their talent specs before the next MC run by Guild Management or risk sitting on the outside looking in.

I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll have some explanation by then on why we NEED 3 or 4 moonkins running around in MC.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had serious trouble trying to download the patch with the ingame updater - I finally just used one of the mirrors and got it installed with no trouble.  From what people were saying online last night, it took some of them up to &lt;em&gt;two hours&lt;/em&gt; to download it.  I don&#039;t know why they didn&#039;t just get it from a mirror!

I haven&#039;t even tried to download all the upgraded addons.  It took me long enough to just get up and running again last night!  I wanted some time in game, with or without my addons.

Druids = good.  Now that I have my talent points back I&#039;m torn about going for a Balance Specialty just so I can get the Moonkin form.  Come on, being a Moonkin would be super cute.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Are you downloading the whole patch or the very simple and small 1.7 &#062; 1.8 patch?  If you are downloading over 200MB then its the wrong patch.

Lots of mirrors are up and my blog has a list... both full and 1.7 &#062; 1.8 upgrade patch.

And my guilds druid is finally going to start playing his 60 druid again.  In a small guild its nice to have as many 60&#039;s around as possible instead of having them play their alts :P

Even if he is a feral druid o_O]]></description>
