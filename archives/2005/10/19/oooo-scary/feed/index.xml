					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think they changed the name from Halloween to be PC but just to make it feel a bit more Warcraft-y. They changed Christmas to Midwinter Festival or somesuch as well... though obviously anything with Christ in the name definitely doesn&#039;t fit WC. Still, I think this was just for flavor.

I agree on it being pretty well done and fun.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Seeing a zombie wearing a carboard scarey human mask and going &#039;OoooOOooh&#039; is just wrong on so many levels, and and the Wickerman is something else.

They&#039;ve certainly put a more effort than is usual for the season in MMOs, bravo!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been like a tourist, snapping screenshots everywhere I go.  I actually posed in front of the fountain in Stormwind because there were all these cool candles on it.  I spent time getting my character to stand just so, so that I could take a screenshot.  Not that anyone is gonna want to see my drag out pictures of my virtual life.  Stop me now!!!  These Halloween additions are just making it more fun.  I love the costumes that you can get at the inns - the ninja one is particularly awesome.  Though being a pirate ain&#039;t too bad either.  Or a giant bat.  Yeah.  That&#039;s fun.]]></description>
