					<description><![CDATA[Not upset at all.  I just really hate vnboards.  And the people on them.  And the people who built them.  And the people who paid for them.  And the people who manufactured the server hardware.  And the people who gave jobs to the people who spawned the inbred fuckwits posting on the boards.  And their mailmen.

Fuck.

Where&#039;s my rifle?]]></description>
