					<description><![CDATA[Pugs for anything above UBRS are suicide...
i did Zul gurub once with a pug (because my 2 guild groups were well stocked on healers/mages :/ ) and it was a horror... 3 priests and only myself (a druid) felt responsible for healing tanks...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh.  One of those.  Ya, we have a few of those pallies in our raids, too.

There is no worse fate than BEING ASSIGNED TO GROUP 8.  That&#039;s right, they can babysit all the hunters and a rogue or two.  They don&#039;t like buffing?  See how they like patch healing.

As soon as the hunters express satisfaction with the paladin assigned to them, we promote him/her to group 7 and assign an even shittier paladin to group 8.

Hey, no one said that being a hunter was going to be easy.

If it&#039;s a pickup group tho, meh, what can ya do.]]></description>
