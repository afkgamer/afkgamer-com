					<description><![CDATA[Huh, and if Senor Excellence stole from his former guild, it&#039;d make sense if they returned those to said former guild.

Wow, people love drama.  (Stirring it up, and then consuming.)

					<description><![CDATA[Hmmm, my new favorite internet link of all time, &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread-search.aspx?ForumName=wow-realm-dragonblight&#038;Author=Excellence&#038;Cluster=Wow&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Excellence&#039;s post archive&lt;/a&gt; seems to be missing a few posts now.  His editing was no match for my copy and paste skills!

Ya, what everyone said about ML.  My guild has had problems too, ours went unreimbursed however.  No real explanation given, which is cool, we didn&#039;t really expect anything to come of the petition.  We still use ML tho.  Safety, habit, we don&#039;t trust each other, something like that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[By allowing for UI modifictaions they&#039;ve given themselves a great out.  They can initially blame almost anything on 3rd party mods, and then change the story later on when they&#039;ve figured out what the problem is.

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure Master Loot isn&#039;t still bugged -- that&#039;s why raids don&#039;t use it. The fear of a bug making it impossible to loot the items is more pressing than the fear of a ninja, I suspect. I&#039;ve heard that they claim to have fixed it, but I&#039;ve heard it has continued to be buggy. Then they claimed that it was UI mods that somehow made it buggy and items unlootable. Not sure I believe that one, but Master Looter still scares me. OTOH, my guild is more careful about recruiting -- only real-life friends&#038;family allowed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Warsong&#039;s first server kill of Rag was done by a guild called Corp Hur, whos guildmaster is probably the most hated man on the server.  A member of their raid (A rogue whos name I forget, who as it turns out joined the guild specifically for the purpose of revenge) ninja&#039;d everything off of Rag&#039;s corpse, including a Spinal Reaper, said &quot;Midnight 4tw!&quot; (a rival guild) and stoned home.  They never got any of their stuff returned.  I guess this was done back when master loot was still bugged.]]></description>
