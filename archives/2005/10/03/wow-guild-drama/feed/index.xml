					<description><![CDATA[Looks like the GM&#039;s action was to _take_ the hide back from OotS and give it to OP, plus ban Officer #1 for scamming.  There&#039;s a reply from OotS in rebuttal, but I don&#039;t think anyone believes anything they say anymore.  Doesn&#039;t make OotS look good, for sure.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll try to recount it to you...

OP is new to this guild, having been a member no more than a couple of days.

OP is part of a high-lvl pickup group raid, where some high-lvl hide drops.  They pay the skinner 100G and give him two rolls on the drop, and everyone else gets one roll.  OP wins the hide.  A fellow guildmate priest who was in the raid gets all pissy about it for some reason and quits the guild over it.

OP puts the hide up in the AH.  Afterwards, OP feels a little bit of remorse about it, and discusses the matter with a guild officer.  By the OPs reckoning, he&#039;s going to give the hide up to go in the guild bank, and get a lot of ZGP and DKP for it.

He mails off the hide, but no reply concerning ZGP (which the OP couldn&#039;t care less about) and DKP (which the OP _does_ want) is forthcoming.  After asking the guild leader about it, he basically gets, &quot;We didn&#039;t authorize Officer #1 to give you any DKP or ZGP.  Thanks for the hide.&quot; 

At this point he&#039;s understandably a little upset, so he goes public with it.  The general consensus is, &quot;Wow, you got ninja&#039;d by your own guild.  Count it as a life lesson learned, complain to a GM, and find another guild.  And good luck with all that.&quot;

Word spreads from the general forum that he posted on, to the realm forum (Dunemaul).  At this point, a couple of asshats from the guild (Order of the Sun) pretty much show their asses in the forum, and the consensus is the same as above with the addition of OotS getting a big fat black eye from it.

At some point in the proceedings Blizz gets involved, but I never saw the actual message.  This thing was 15+ pages on each thread (general and Dunemaul), so I could&#039;ve easily overlooked it.

Finally, some OotS officer high enough to do something about it (the founder I think) gets on, says that it&#039;s all been a big misunderstanding, OotS is really a great bunch of guys who&#039;d never ninja loot, the asshats are really wonderful people once you get to know them, and OP will be getting his hide back.  Most posters think that this was done more to try to put out the flames rather than it being the Right Thing To Do, but  are glad to see justice done in the end.  OP drops a couple of hints that it might be a little more than a misunderstanding, but takes the high road and lets it drop.  He&#039;s getting his hide back, which is more than he expected.

That was pretty much where I left it.  The Dunemaul villagers were gathered around OotS with the torches, demanding the asshats&#039; heads, but nothing had come of that last I saw.  Funny stuff, but it stops being funny when it starts being you.

					<description><![CDATA[BLEH!  The poster deleted his threads this morning, typical drama ho technique -- get everyone worked up then pull the evidence.

I&#039;ll try to find a cache or cut/paste job somewhere ... which is a needle in haystack type task since the forum search HAS NEVER WORKED.  Anyways, a reasonably accurate summary can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-realm-dunemaul&amp;t=110932&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, (also cited in my comment above) from the Guild&#039;s perspective.  If that&#039;s deleted, all we&#039;ll have left is fond memories of a drama that was.

I can&#039;t archive every forum drama that comes along.  That would be a fulltime job.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Think the boards were down (again) for a while last night.  They&#039;ve been touch and go this week.  (thx, Nebu!)

The original post in the first link summarizes the drama, the second link has all the wannabe gangsta rap from the hapless poster&#039;s (former) guild.  You don&#039;t need to wade through all the pages on the first link to get the full dramatic effect.

This is almost better than HBO!

UPDATE:  and there&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?FN=wow-realm-dunemaul&amp;T=110033&quot;&gt;MORE&lt;/a&gt;!  Final, official guild response &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-realm-dunemaul&amp;t=110932&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>
