					<description><![CDATA[Yes, this does make you more old skool, however, no one ever believes the alpha guys really are alpha guys.

Kinda like the cancer operation people.  Of course there must be players that actually do need cancer operations -- too bad for them, cuz the attention ho&#039;s have already worked that for sympathy on every message board that ever was or ever will be.

That analogy kinda sucks but I wanted to bitch about the fake cancer operation people.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[well i&#039;m in alpha... so am i even more old school?

alpha impressions so far: ignore this game

if something new and shiny can barely drag me away from lvl&#039;n up my 3rd 60, then it must not be that good right?

meh, you decide]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really don&#039;t see how they can increase the level limit without borrowing another stupid idea from Everquest: AA points. After all, the warrior bug that gave a single extra talent point caused some emergency hotfixing and all sorts of havoc on the message boards (not really anything new there)...could you imagine what would happen with 10 talent points?]]></description>
