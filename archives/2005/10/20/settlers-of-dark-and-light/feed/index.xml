					<description><![CDATA[Not that I think it&#039;s so good that I&#039;d still pay for it, but I didn&#039;t think Horizons was all that bad.  It&#039;s big problems IMHO were:

- The XP system offered no incentive to group.  Pickup groups were next to nonexistent.

- If anything, the main town was _too_ big.  Imagine SW on steroids, with no guides or signs on the doors.

- Lack of endgame content.  I got this second-hand from my retired gaming friend who played 10 hours a day, because I didn&#039;t get to the endgame.

- And the biggie, which was that there was nothing all that compelling about the game.  If MMORPGs were ice cream, Horizons would be vanilla.

The exception to the vanilla comment was Horizons&#039; crafting system, which I thought was totally awesome (for a crafting system).]]></description>
