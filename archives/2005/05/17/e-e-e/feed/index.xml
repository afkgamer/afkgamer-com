					<description><![CDATA[As of a couple of years ago, you need to be associated with a company within in the industry to go.

What are you missing?

-bumping shoulders with hundreds of sweaty mole-people who have come out of their game-dev caves for the annual Running of the Booth Babes,

-overhearing bits of conversations from people more geeky than you, no matter how geeky you are,

-more lame yet colorful displays in a smaller area than you would believe possible,

-dumb ass tchotchkies, and

-long lines for expensive crap food (which is really only more a problem if you&#039;re working the show).

Also, of course, Sturgeon&#039;s Law is in full effect: 90% of everything you see is utter, utter crap.

Oh yeah, you&#039;ll also get to hear either about some game that won&#039;t come out for three more years winning Best of Show (for the third year straight), or the Best of Show winner for the last three years won&#039;t be out yet.

E3 is only fun in your imagination.  I can&#039;t take even three minutes of the G4 coverage without having flashbacks of running demoes in a over-crowded booth years ago.

&lt;em&gt;&quot;Suddenly, I viddied what I had to do, and what I had wanted to do, and that was to do myself in; to snuff it, to blast off for ever out of this wicked, cruel world. One moment of pain perhaps and, then, sleep for ever, and ever and ever.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;a fucked newsfeed that sends all their old posts as new material every time my feed reader refreshes&quot;

tell me about it.  My best guess is that it is refreshing each story every time a new &#039;reference&#039; is added.

Sadly, many of the blog sites seem to do this.]]></description>
