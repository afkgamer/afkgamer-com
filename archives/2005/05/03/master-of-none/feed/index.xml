					<description><![CDATA[Man let me tell you something absolutely amazing about nc, I&#039;d been having this horrible texture loading error (video driver [hp much hate]) and I sent them a message at 3:00 a.m.  15 minutes later they respond with a link to a new video driver.  Wow! They are really on top of things.  The same thing happened when I lost my exclusive pre order item (waves targe casually and tosses into trashcan) as you can see I got it back. . .]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For each &#039;henchman&#039;, be they machine or human controlled, your share of gold decreases as it&#039;s shared out evenly amongst those in your group. I&#039;ve also notice that the drop rate of items is lower than if you were to solo it. Personally I like to compromise and just take a healer along for the ride.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You are correct, sir.  No charge for henchmen that I&#039;ve seen either, but you don&#039;t get as much loot if they&#039;re along ... either because they engage or do the most damage to a mob, hell if I know.  Just like my Master trainer, they kick some major butt.

Well-behaved group members, too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The henchmen don&#039;t seem to charge anything, maybe it&#039;s just that as a level 7 noob I don&#039;t have to pay or maybe it is low enough that I don&#039;t notice the charge.  ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[HENCHMEN?!?!?  I don&#039;t do henchmen.  Mostly because I&#039;m cheap as hell in virtual worlds, but it&#039;s also a pride thing.  It starts with hiring henchmen, next thing you know, I&#039;m dancing in my underwear by the main gate shouting &quot;CANT TOUCH THIS!&quot;

Ya, message boards are a cesspit, but I wouldn&#039;t be opposed to a strictly-moderated official forum.  I&#039;d bitch about it, of course, but I think it could work.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[message boards are usually a pain in the ass, but that doesn&#039;t mean that we want to do without them.
Personally i expect message boards with any game nowadays, i find them entertaining to be honest, and it&#039;s definitly nice if you can find some official info now and then]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Are you soloing?  I have a sneaking suspicion that the mob&#039;s level reflects the expectation that a full group will be going against it.  I always grab a full party of henchmen before I leave town.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[After seeing the WoW boards I really don&#039;t blame companies for saying screw it. I have *never* seen a worse place to post. In fact, the internet bbs I call my &quot;home&quot; is pretty much a hate site and it&#039;s still warmer than the WoW forums. 

I&#039;m not sure who I hate more, the whiners or the absolute losers who record a song tribute to &quot;captian placeholder&quot;. 

Yes I have issues. ]]></description>
