					<description><![CDATA[Omg, I go on vmk too. Its the best site ever. Even though im 16 years old, it is still enjoyable and i have made a many of new friends....from the computer! I never knew i can have such relationships (friendships) through cyber space. I didnt know i could have so much fun either while on a Disney program for kids under my age. I reccomend to make children go on vmk, if i loved it they would surely love it too, maybe more!]]></description>
