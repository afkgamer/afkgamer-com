					<description><![CDATA[ffs, think I just had kick the database.  That&#039;s goofy as hell.

EDIT:  For any other WP users that have a similar feed problem when upgrading, either a new post and comment, or editing previously-posted ones, will fix the feeds.  Other than that, was an easy, troublefree upgrade.

EDIT2:  Above only fixes feeds as long as there is activity w/i the last 24 hours.  Permanent fix is outlined &lt;a href=&quot;http://fernando.dubtribe.com/archives/2005/05/10/solution-to-wp151-rss-errors/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>
