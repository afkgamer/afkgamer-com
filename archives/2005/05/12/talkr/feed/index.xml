					<description><![CDATA[Oh Lord, have mercy.  It&#039;s the AT&#038;T robotic lady reading a post.  Dammit, no obscenities and only an excerpt.  Not sure why only an excerpt; my feed does full posts ... unless, unless this is an evil plot to get me to subscribe.

WHY MUST THE GODS TORTURE ME SO?!?!?

Heh, thanks man.  Got quite a chuckle from that and I&#039;m sure my cult following will want to enjoy their morning commute with the AT&amp;T lady reading AFK Gamer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, I just thought I&#039;d point you to an audio file from a recent AFK Gamer post.  It&#039;s only 21 seconds long, as the RSS feed that I found only included post summaries.

This is the audio of a post entitled &quot;Incoming. Lots.&quot; (sorry, no obscenities in this one):

Thanks,
