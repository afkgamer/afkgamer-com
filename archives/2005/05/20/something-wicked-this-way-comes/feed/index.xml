					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll take the collectible mourning cds, I need too finish off my collection. I miss the 30 esrp cd, 3rd week edition and rumor has it if I don&#039;t get it soon egomancer will sue my ass for all the pizza hut coupons in nevada, which is a lot, more than 50 transactions worth you get from using Station Exchange.

And speaking of freeman, I need a gameboy in the shape of the ps3 controller that will also take flight when I try and smash it with a sledge hammer.

Bawdy potty-mouth humor is accepted as long as it&#039;s tasteful, haha tasteful sounds like more of a grey area, excellent. Good chance I may be joining the festivities as a full-fledged carny.]]></description>

Yep. That&#039;s why the PS3 controller was designed to come back to you when you throw it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Allowing artistic use of profanity doesn&#039;t mean you fuckers should take advantage of that.  If we have to return to mocking others with &quot;fag&quot; and &quot;retard&quot;, would be dark times for all of us in the nonexistent gaming blog-o-sphere.

I&#039;ll pitch in $2 for a &quot;Buy Krones&#039; Artistic Freedom&quot; fund.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a good use of profanity...(thank you /.)

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Iwata said the new console is aimed at customers who hate clutter and find current games and the controllers used to play them to be confusing and difficult.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;

[edit]But then I thought about some of the &#039;fun&#039; I&#039;ve had playing San Andreas lately. Hitting the correct shoulder button is an exercise in &quot;Dammit!&quot;. I keep hitting the L3 button by accident whenever I make a sharp turn. (Oh, brilliant design there, Sony. Put a button where I can accidently hit it a LOT.) Then I played that damn dancing level where the button shapes would fly by and I had to hit the right one. Yeah Sony, thanks for using heiroglyphics for your button labels.&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, I&#039;m all for the &quot;tasteful&quot; use of colorful language. Swearing is inextricably connected to video games, as many a hurled controller (or mouse) will attest to. I guess I should have clarified it by saying &quot;overly&quot; profane. I&#039;ll add that as an update this evening.

Let&#039;s be honest, some of that stuff can be funny. Just because I don&#039;t use it doesn&#039;t mean I don&#039;t find it funny.]]></description>
