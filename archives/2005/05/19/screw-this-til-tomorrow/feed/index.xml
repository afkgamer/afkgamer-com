					<description><![CDATA[Call me anti-social, but one of my favorite things about Guild Wars is that I&#039;ve been able to treat it like a 1 player game for the most part.  I grab my henches and bounce, and when we wipe, I&#039;m the only one who gets to bask in the failure.  Once I get to a high enough level for one of the arenas, I spend a level or two there, and getting pissed off at those people is like getting angry over a round of Counterstrike.  

With WOW, there were definitely some quite nights on vent, where no one wants to talk for fear of saying something like &quot;So we just really really suck right?&quot;.  Some nights on the PVP servers, just getting into BRS could hours if Alliance had a really strong prescence in BRM. I imagine my guildmates logging off of vent and then weeping quietly in front of their monitors.]]></description>
