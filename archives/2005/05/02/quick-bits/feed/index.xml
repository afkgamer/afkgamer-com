Hehe, I thought Anon was just a guy who responded to every one of your posts and always had something to say.  How wrong and dumb I was!  Didn&#039;t know it was short for Anonymous.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Weeeeee, and down the rabbit hole we go!

First I heard of this mysterious server transfer of a Warcraft guild (the link in the 7:25 pm comment ... which leads to 38 other links about what maybe happened and what the Blizzard Collective is telling everyone to SHUT UP ABOUT, OMG DON&#039;T TALK ABOUT THIS, IT&#039;S PRIVATE).

So, will take me the rest of the night to figure out what maybe happened and then another five minutes to point out the obvious, for which I will take full credit, obviously.

Good news hound work tho, Anonymous!  AFK Gamer could use an unpaid summer intern like you!

And to think I was going to write a little snippet about how much difference a day can make with Guild Wars and that I might not hate that game after all.

NO TIME FOR THAT NOW.  We&#039;re on a full drama alert, people!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[More richness - apparently this Uther guild moved to Eldre&#039;Thalas due to being on the receiving end of harassment.  They have a site here:  http://apathy.brokentoys.org/  which sort of implies a relation to http://www.brokentoys.org/ here (aka Lum the Mad, who&#039;s now working for Mythic).

Curiouser and curiouser.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While it was funny, it was also pretty stupid. Spitting on a GM telling you to knock it off is like flipping off a bouncer telling you to cool it at a nightclub.  The same sort of people would probably be complaining &quot;You can&#039;t do this! I didn&#039;t go anything wrong! My cover charge pays your salary!  This is an abuse of power!&quot; while being tossed out the front door.  Of course, everyone else in the club is laughing at the idiot getting the treatment]]></description>
