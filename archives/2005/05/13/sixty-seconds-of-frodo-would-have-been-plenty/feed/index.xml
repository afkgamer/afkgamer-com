					<description><![CDATA[A live blog is one that&#039;s not dead.  (duh!)

Actually, it&#039;s a technique.  It has the immediacy and the rawness of performance art.  Free of the usual edit and polish, live blog posts are edgy and ripe with the emotion and passion of the moment in which they were created.

Or, it&#039;s bitching real time via the blog.

(Never let it be said that I&#039;m not a master of bullshit.)]]></description>
