					<description><![CDATA[Then there must be a god-mode/invuln/faction hack floating around too which points to a far larger problem then level ones looting chests.

And really, why address that issue headon when it&#039;s easier to patch in level limits on instances so that those with lowbie twinks, guildmates or friends are restricted also.

As I said, my alt is almost 60 so impacts me not.  There is a breaking point where an alt&#039;s aggro is so large that running them thru an instance for BOP is too dangerous; if the level limits are wider than that, then good deal. 

Nerfing regular play to address a couple of shitheads that SS their level ones in the big boys&#039; dungeon is a very slippery slope, however.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The previous post explained that already.

Teleport hacks i.e.e they warp underground and float up to just below the chests and are able to loot.

There were a few threads on the boards with ss of groups of lvl 1&#039;s in the high end dungeons, and a 10 second google turned up a lot of fun happy message boards willing to show you exactly how to do it.

Not a nerf, unless you needed to exploit to have fun.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First, I challenge the math that&#039;s indicating level one teleporters looting chests are a significant hit to the e-conomy.

Chest looting has SUCKED for a good long while and most are well guarded.  Level one would be dead in one hit, ergo, no loot, unless he has a buddy along to clear and then ... errr, why wouldn&#039;t the buddy just loot it?

Second, I twink, I&#039;m a big twinker.  Some hate the twink job, others (many) love it.  To each his own.

Even prior to the Honor-Only system, over-geared lower levels weren&#039;t swaying PVP one way or the other, so what business is it of anyone&#039;s if players want to run their lowbies thru the Deadmines or Scarlet Monastery, etc?  

The huge aggro area of an underleveled character was deterrent enough.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Like Dominik and Non say, they really mean it when they claim it won&#039;t affect normal play -- where normal play includes twinking the utter crap out of your alts.

And the patch progress bar is based on file count, not estimated time.  There&#039;s a big chunk in the middle it just flies through, probably for all the icon textures -- hundreds of &#039;em, unlikely to be touched by a patch.  And there&#039;s some big files towards the end.

What pisses me off is the Russian Roulette that patching is.  The 1.4.2 patch decided to up and kill my install.  For just such emergencies I keep a backup of my install -- copy it back, repatch 1.4.0, 1.4.1 and 1.4.2, and it&#039;s fine.  Sigh.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[drop rates for arcane crystalls (those matter!) have not been changed as far as i can tell.

Concerning the minimum levels, they mostly are 2 levels below the quest-minimum level, so you probably won&#039;t even notice..]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, some guy took his lvl 11 friend through the Deadmines/VanCleef instance for a pickup group I was in, so I doubt this can be considered a huge nerf.  Well, the hardcore powerlevelers might.  

Incidentally, I&#039;m wondering if they increased the drop rates on gems.  I don&#039;t have any high level miners, but I have seen more stuff out of copper veins at least recently.

Never go on an adventure without a hat!
