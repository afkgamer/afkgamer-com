					<description><![CDATA[I thank you for this lovely story. It is not often that I am fabulously entertained and pick up an important life lesson.

At a future point, please share more of your thoughts on &#039;detonation.&#039; Because that was just brilliant. If you&#039;d have just said &quot;that&#039;s why you need an /incoming message, Brainiac,&quot; it wouldn&#039;t been nearly as potent.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve found that mobs gangbang the monk even if he/she/it does absolutely nothing.  Only thing that seems to mitigate is having the monk stand back 20+ paces or so.  Dunno what that&#039;s all about.

Doesn&#039;t help that the monks have to wear pajamas either.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The one thing I don&#039;t like in GW is aggro management.  Well, in a way, I guess it&#039;s more &quot;realistic&quot; that when you fight a group of mobs, one or two peel off and head straight for the healer and start chomping.

What sucks is the only way to get those mobs off the healer is to kill them.  They will only rarely notice me shooting them repeatedly in the back or whacking them with my hammer or whatever primary_attack_01 is and switch targets.

On the other hand it&#039;s kind of nice that the warriors can&#039;t just sit there and taunt all the mobs on to them for convenient nuking, and you actually have to pay attention to what&#039;s going on around you.  It also simulates the PVP experience, since your any monk(s) you have might as well wear armor with a big kick me sign taped to the back :)]]></description>
