					<description><![CDATA[I tried GW today for a couple of hours. Friend let me make a char on his acount. WOW that game needs a LOT of work on it&#039;s interface and &quot;teaching&quot; newb players like myself how to play the game. My first impression is that the game is REALY bad. It&#039;s basicly Diablo 2 but with less polish.

The world design is horrible although it looks fairly pritty. Whats with not being able to jump? What&#039;s with those pain in the ass &quot;invisible&quot; walls? ARG. And that 8 spells only thing? Jeez that&#039;s anoying. I can see all the people who loved playing Diablo 2 liking this game, but i also see the game lasting for only a year TOPS. 

I dont doubt that the game will become a mega hit in Korea as a lot of online games do in that area of the world.

Small side note: What&#039;s with almost all of the male necromancer faces looking asian? I felt like i was playing Lineage: The Bloodpledge when i was designing my necro. har har har]]></description>
