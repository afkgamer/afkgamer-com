					<description><![CDATA[LOL...I just imagined Antonia with a beard, that would be too funny ;)

I have to say that I plan to enter the contest and I would have a lot of fun playing Everquest II in real life. It beats the 9-5 job I have right now!

					<description><![CDATA[Here were some of my favorite parts from the article.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In addition to being the object of desire of every 20th-level dwarf online&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whatever. EVERYONE knows that dwarves like their women bearded.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The winner will receive a one-year modeling contract with SOE, a photo spread in Stuff and additional prizes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yeah. It&#039;s degrading... but enough dumb college kids who do nothing but buy EA games will buy it. Sometimes, I hate pop culture. ]]></description>
