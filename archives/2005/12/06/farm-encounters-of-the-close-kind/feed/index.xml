					<description><![CDATA[[...] Most farmer encounters are more amusing than frustrating. At the very least, many of them know how to play. Many of them know how to play more adeptly than native English-speakers. If you have a moral objection to folks making money of of the game, I guess I can understand a reluctance to have them participate in a raid group. If you&#8217;re just doing it to be a dick&#8230;well, who&#8217;s doing the &#8216;wrong thing&#8217; then, the farmer or the raid leader? They&#8217;re just doing their job.

					<description><![CDATA[I am glad to see someone is actually aware of our farming friends. I found your website thanks to a quick google on &#039;gold&#039; &#039;farming&#039; &#039;warcraft&#039;, and your insights have been invaluable in discovering these people on my own server. One late night, whilst heavily inebriated, I invited several of these farmers (who incidentally all happened to be level 60 hunters, in Maraudon) to join my group - and amazingly they did. I too tried my hand at international relations, only to be met with terse responses. Even typing &#039;$$$$$&#039; was met with confusion, followed by an uneasy silence.

I have tried to discuss the potential effects on the economics of the game with my fellow server inhabitants, but the general feeling is a) I don&#039;t care, or b) I&#039;m too busy buying gold off ebay to care.

I demand that you continue your relentless persuit of these people, as it&#039;s quite funny to read about.]]></description>
