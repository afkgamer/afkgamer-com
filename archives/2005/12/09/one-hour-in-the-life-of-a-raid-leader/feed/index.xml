					<description><![CDATA[ahhh the joy of the gkick. we got that pleasure just the night when an initiate, thinking he was leet cause he&#039;s a dwarf priest, just couldn&#039;t understand how there wasn&#039;t a spot in the raid because it was full with members and that initiates don&#039;t get spots over members. after a few minutes of crying justice was served. oh the joy.

and about you 30 mins to setup/send out invites...
have you ever heard of GEM?? Guild Event Manager. its great, it lets you schedule raids ingame where anyone who has GEM(mandatory for raiding in our guild) can look at the raid events and subscribe with any of their characters to the raid, all while in game. and then the person who setup the event can just click the &quot;invite all&quot; button and it invites everyone in the order they subscribed. its a great tool, we get invites out and head to the raid in under 10 mins of start time now.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Why is the _Raid_ Leader dealing with _Guild_ recruits? The latter should be the _Guild_ Leader&#039;s job, or (better) the Recruit Liason Officer&#039;s. 

Forming groups: I don&#039;t know how it works in WoW, but in EQ we used to just say: Everyone set lfg on, clerics grab balanced groups, then the raid leader would just invite the fully formed groups into the raid.

Both times, Delegation FTW.]]></description>
