					<description><![CDATA[I thought it was simple -- being in a beta is a way to save $50 if the game sucks, and a way to learn enough about the game early enough to convince your friends to play it with you if it doesn&#039;t suck. The sneak peeks and reviews never give enough information to work this out, IMO.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Plus if you&#039;re in on the beta, you have a chance to de-noob yourself before everyone else, while also getting to meet people who are probably going to end up playing the game.  That way, when the &quot;e-penix race&quot; begins at release, you and your beta buddies will have a leg up on the rest of the competition.

Personally, I love that noob feeling of a fresh game.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For me, the point is checking out a new game and having something different to do.  Others may like helping companies fix the game for no pay?  I&#039;ve never met such a person but maybe they exist.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Unless a dev is going to pay me there is no way I&#039;m gonna waste my time testing their game for them. Why do people get so excited over (barely) beta tests? Is it completely wasting your time worth it when you can say &quot;Yea, I was in beta&quot;.

Not trying to be a dick but what&#039;s the point?]]></description>
