					<description><![CDATA[This chair is flipping bullsheit, in fact this chair is softcore, must be a carebear. A legitmiate gamer&#039;s chair will come equipped with a built in bed pan that recycles poop into brownies and some tubes that hook up to the genitals so cat asses don&#039;t piss all over themselves when ensuing their dkp points night and day. The deluxe edition would also keep the computer cool at all times and punch players in the penis when they died. Foton and I should make this dream come true, we could call it, the vision.  Patent Pending!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[30 inches wide.  So maybe a catasser couldn&#039;t fit his ass, but normal people could.  And in the smaller pic, looks like a girl in the one chair and her dad in the other?  Or maybe that&#039;s the 50 year old pervert she met on the internet.  He looks comfortable anyways.  And excited!  

Maybe a little too excited.]]></description>
