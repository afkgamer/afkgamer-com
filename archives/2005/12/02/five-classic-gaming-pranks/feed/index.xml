					<description><![CDATA[My favorite prank of all time was back in the first few months of EQ release. I was playing a necromancer and when you got up to a certain level you could cast a spell on your pet to be able to talk through him. Kind of useless until I found out that it could also be used on NPCs!

I spent many hours in Freeport using my new found skill. I&#039;d cast on the npc then invis myself and wait for a noob to come along. I&#039;d then give him a mighty quest to travel across the continent and talk to soandso. The best was when they&#039;d start shouting to form a group for a &#039;GM Quest&#039; and go on their merry way to fame and fortune. It was cruel, but oh so fun. The bug was fixed in the next patch and the game went downhill from there.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Damn.  I forgot one of my favorite pranks of all time:  the unintentional /quit.

Then there&#039;s the intentional /q to fake an LD because you&#039;re ducking a group or a raid, but that&#039;s not a prank, rather self preservation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The &quot;press alt-f4&quot; style of joke is as old as online communication. I remember one multi line chat BBS back in the &#039;80s where the joke went like this:

Newb: &quot;How do I access the online games section?&quot;

Bastard: &quot;/z online games&quot;

/z was of course the command that disconnected you from the BBS.

Mages aren&#039;t the only ones who can have fun. The old priest mind control and run your buddy off the cliff is good fun.]]></description>
