					<description><![CDATA[Welcome Raster and happy posting oO

I&#039;m writting this totally useless comment, &#039;cause when I read the title in my feeds the first thing I thought was &quot;Huh? Yet another Jack Thompson post?&quot;, than came Fight Club... Jack Thompson comes up before a favourite movie reference? I hate him with a passion now, before that I was just amused with him.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmmmm you know Finster, thats one of the main reasons I bought WoW as well. Had no intention of ever buying it until started reading first n3rfed and then AFKgamer.

See Foton you are responsible for the neglect I have shown friends and family.

Anyways

Welcome to the club Raster, this should be interesting.

Oh yeah Foton you did remember to go back and delete all the nasty things you said about him right?.....

:D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[And now we know the REAL reason Raster was invited to post...

In all seriousness, you guys are hilarious. Your WoW posts were a large ingredient in why I purchased WoW this past month. (Well, that and I&#039;m a masochist.)

Anyway, gotta go play WoW while ignoring my wife.]]></description>
