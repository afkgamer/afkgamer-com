					<description><![CDATA[i would like to add [besides the counter-intuitiveness] that GW has the DUMBEST AI of any game i have ever played. Not the funny AI where lets say the henchmen run around in circles no but the frustrating kind when you point your flag thingy on the map away from a fuckload of mobs so they wont agro while i sacrifice myself to make them go away and guess what they jump right into the fight we all die death penalty occurs and you have to start the encounter all over again]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with DeathBeaver. I was a little confused with this game for like 5 minutes but once i got into Lakeside County I started getting the hang of it. 

Only a retard who sucks at games would not understand the things you just mentioned in this article.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ahh, I see the problem here:  you&#039;re an idiot. That and you have the attention span of a 8-year-old ADD kid on speed and have the reasoning skills of my sock. I played AO for about 6 months and there is no way in hell that GW is as counter-intuitive as AO. I solved every single one of your laughable &#039;dilemas&#039; in my first 20 minutes in the game. What&#039;s this? An item is unidentified? I wonder what this little thing called an &#039;Identification Kit&#039; could do? You know, the thing that you can buy from the NPC with the clearly displayed &#039;Merchant&#039; tag next to his name? Hey, you know these items that I&#039;m getting at the beginning of the game kindof suck.  I wonder why:  maybe because I&#039;m at the fucking BEGINNING of the game. I mean obviously one should assume to find all the uber-1337 shit in the training area right? Hmm...this guy is telling me that if I hit &#039;Yes&#039; I will accept necromancer as my secondary profession...I don&#039;t want necromancer as my secondary profession...ahh what the hell, I&#039;ll hit &#039;Yes&#039; anyway. Hey! Why is my secondary profession necromancer?! I guess reading a few lines of text was a bit much for you.  Guild answer: I dunno.  Hey! You should be in good company! You&#039;re in a guild of fucking retards! WOOO!!!! Here&#039;s a tip for ya - find a guild that isn&#039;t comprised of *gasp* fucking retards. I suppose I&#039;d have a really hard time with this game too if, with one hand, I covered my eyes, and with the other I randomly smashed the keyboard while screaming &#039;Derrr! Derrr! Derrr!&#039; I guess the creators of GW didn&#039;t anticipate your total and utter lack of anything remotely resembling intelligence. You sir, are a fucktard. If you can&#039;t figure out stuff this fucking simple, maybe you should just stop playing video games. There are enough idiots clogging up the net as it is, it definitely doesn&#039;t need you too.

Disregard that, I suck cocks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, the classic &quot;grow some hair between your legs&quot; smack. I&#039;m impressed, should we break out the &quot;your momma&quot; jokes as well? Those are always good for a good old-fashioned romp of puerility.

But hey, that&#039;s okay, Learn2Write articles that aren&#039;t terrible - articles with the analytical prowess of a 5-year-old.

So let me get this straight...somehow, updates in GW have made you no longer assume that you&#039;ll get good items in the noob area of the game? Updates have somehow made you read text that tells you that you are choosing a secondary profession - text that has been present since launch day? Updates have somehow made the relationship between the words &quot;unidentified&quot; and &quot;identification&quot; more clear?

Sorry, but I&#039;m still seeing a great deal of faulty critical analysis here. These complaints that you&#039;ve made are not the result of rational analysis, they&#039;re the result of impatience and a short attention span. And as for expecting good equipment in the training area, well, I&#039;m not sure what to put that off on other than a lack of intelligence. Try to divert attention all you want, your comments are still idiotic and unwarranted.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s ok, Learn2Read.

This was written on GW opening day, first few hours of play.  GW since then substantially improved the noob areas and noob experience, as I wrote not long after this.  Also, I admitted during my GW series and in other posts that I become easily annoyed with differing UI&#039;s and game systems which is not the fault of the designer, but rather mine.  Getting old, y&#039;know.

Now I answered you with far more civility than you deserved.  Come back when you grow some hair between your legs.]]></description>
