					<description><![CDATA[Goddamn, I had to google that.  Sounded made up.  Doesn&#039;t sound much better after a google either.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yaoicon.com/whatisyaoi.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;What is Yaoi&lt;/a&gt;?

If Guild Wars has a bunch of ponies and hair ribbons, I&#039;m out.

UPDATE:  there&#039;s hair ribbons alright.  Although they don&#039;t seem to be a focus of the game, and there are no ponies in evidence.  Point in GW&#039;s favor.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Probably have to replace your keyboard often with that kind of research.  If you buy one of those extended warranties at Best Buy for the keyboard, do you think it would cover something like that?  Would they try to investigate why the keys were inoperative or would they just put on rubber gloves and quietly dispose of it?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;I look at it as I&#039;m supporting the arts. If only gaming houses would organize as charitable entities -- and from what I&#039;ve heard, many of them should -- my gaming budget would be considered donations. For the value I&#039;ve received in return with some of these MMOs, I have a strong case here.&quot;
  Oh yeah I hear you brother.
  
  BTW I also have a strong case in my constant masturbation is actually contributing to a cure for cancer. Erm, I have to go and clean my hands now.]]></description>
