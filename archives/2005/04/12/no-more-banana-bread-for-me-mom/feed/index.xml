					<description><![CDATA[Seeing as how I&#039;m not rich yet, I&#039;ve definitely missed my calling for something.  

Evil?  Most assuredly.  Genius?  Still working on it.

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s what I&#039;m saying.  I have been in situations where I have cleared all the mobs around a chest and when I engage the last one some ass comes in and grabs the chest.  Yeah they know it&#039;s wrong.  Usually at this point I dismiss my pet and feign.  Imagine the surprise of seeing the booty in the chest and then BANG!  Mob is in your ass!

I just don&#039;t think Blizz is ever going to do anything about it.  Mainly because the solution is too complex and would require too much code.  There are better things for them to burn dev cycles on.  How bout some more abilities for my pet?  High end content?  The griff paths are better now but I really would rather they follow the solid line on the map when you pick your destination.  Just fly straight there.

Gamers have long ass memories as evidenced by Foton in an earlier entry.  The habitual Chest Griefer will get his or her just due at some point.  I played EQ way too long and saw way to much to think that what goes around doesn&#039;t come around.  

For what it&#039;s worth I think you did the right thing.  After all he tried to ninja first.  He got what he had coming.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Let&#039;s not pretend that there&#039;s some confusion over who&#039;s killing what and maybe the guy that&#039;s downed an entire camp needs some assistance in working the spawns.

Even the rawest noob understands on a basic level what&#039;s polite and what&#039;s not, because I know for damn sure he wouldn&#039;t walk into a restaurant IRL and pick food off my plate because it looked like &quot;I wasn&#039;t going to finish that.&quot;

Not a big deal, agreed.  But I&#039;ve had it uptohere with the pretense that there&#039;s some misunderstanding.  We&#039;re not talking about Live Day One near Stormwind.  We&#039;re talking a few months out in level 50 zones.  We all understand what&#039;s what by now.

Ok, I kinda got off on a rant there, but if even *I* can figure out civil human behavior, I think everyone else can also.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Uh never?  Which mob is is keyed to?  If it is keyed to all the mobs what if I kill some and you kill some?  It is too complex a solution for a simple and minor problem.

I have had chests robbed.  It&#039;s not that big a deal.  Shit happens.  You deal with it and move on.  I have gotten way more loot off mobs then in chests.  I would say that 99% of my loot is mob based and not chest based.  So if I get jacked for 1% of my loot so be it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So...any bets on how long before Blizz associates the chests with mobs and only lets the one creditted with the kill to open the chest?]]></description>
