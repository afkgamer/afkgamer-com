					<description><![CDATA[Even tho I am not the one you are asking..
With no due respect what so ever, mr griefer, you&#039;r such a reet I am speechless.

&quot;Let me ask you: how&#039;s your kids college fund coming?&quot;
I don&#039;t got any kids, but believe you me, when the day comes
there wont be an issue about providing or not

&quot;Is your wife happy with you sitting at the 21st century boob tube for 20 hours at a time?&quot;
I don&#039;t got a wife at the time of being, but I have a habit of finding female aquintances
with the same interests as me.. thats right.. boob tube.

&quot;What have you done to improve yourself lately? (and no, the purple legendary weapon you looted doesn&#039;t count)&quot;
I work out every day, earn quite a lot more money than other people my age, doing a job I love doing, and am good at doing it. Oh, even tho it doesn&#039;t count, I also got loads of purple epixx, but no purple legendary weapons(?). And I think it does count, since imho. life is about having fun, I have a great irl life and have fun raiding with both irl and wow-friends. And you know, some of the encounters can be quite challenging, so of all the things I have done to improve myself lately, I am by far most happy with the raiding accomplishments.

I feel kinda moronic answering these stupid questions, but your narrow minded head
deserves answers..]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jeeze, was high school so bad for you that you have to go to these lengths to re-engineer the experience with you on top?

drooling morons, eh? Because they can&#039;t kill an imaginary foozits in some &#039;escape from reality&#039; waste of time?

Let me ask you... how&#039;s your kids college fund coming? Is your wife happy with you sitting at the 21st century boob tube for 20 hours at a time?

If none of these apply, then... what have you done to improve yourself lately? (and no, the purple legendary weapon you looted doesn&#039;t count)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow Chef - a fellow unguilded high level player (holy shit!)

I can also vouch for this &quot;popular unguilded dood&quot; phenomenon - as long as you&#039;re not a total jackass/douchebag, the /tells come fast and furious.  Where are their guildmates, and why aren&#039;t they helping them with their instance runs?

And no kidding about the dramaqueen bullshit - any surprise that some of us want nothing to do with guilds?  Though if you&#039;re serious about the evil guild, call it &quot;The Pariahs&quot; or something like that.  It&#039;d be wonderful to see how large of an implosion such a guild would be (make sure they post to multiple gaming message boards for maximum drama).  :)

					<description><![CDATA[This is part of the reason why I cannot stand guilds. They act like bitchy women at the slightest infraction. I must admit that it&#039;s fun to make fun of the MMO nerds in IF while camping auctions. Tell a lvl 60 uberguild priest that he wasted his money on an epic mount and watch the sparks fly. They are so easy to flame that it&#039;s amazing. 

The whole blacklisting thing is silly. I act like a total jerk sometimes and still get 3+ guild invites a day. In fact, being the only unguilded lvl 56 character on the server makes you quite annoyingly popular. 

I have been flirting with the thought of creating a guild of outcasts, jerks, griefers, ninja looters, trollers and flamers - providing no leadership and see what happens. At this point, being banned would be more exciting than Blizzard&#039;s end game content. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A few months in VT taught most EQ guilds (The ones who hadn&#039;t learned earlier from Velious, that is) to spy, lie, KS and train - or at least, to expect other people to.
