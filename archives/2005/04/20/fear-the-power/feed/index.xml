					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not saying &#039;never&#039; either, but after dealing with SOE over the years, this step comes as no shock.  It&#039;s all about making the quickest buck possible, and this is the quickest possible buck.  I had to laugh at Smedley&#039;s explanation: 40% of our CS time is spent dealing with people who&#039;ve broken the rules and are unhappy about it, so let&#039;s make the customers who &lt;i&gt;weren&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; breaking the rules unhappy instead.  That&#039;ll show &#039;em!

Screw trying to make the advancement process interesting enough that people actually want to &lt;i&gt;play&lt;/i&gt; our game instead of skipping most of it - we&#039;ll make it boring as hell and take cash to get to the fun. Farmers camping quest-drop spawns 24/7 so people trying to have fun in the game can&#039;t? Hey, more cash for us.

I guess I wouldn&#039;t mind the whole thing so much if they included a mandatory course with each account sold: &quot;How not to be a retard in groups, in 10 easy lessons.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The only thing that surprises me about the Sony market is that it took so long.  An opportunity to make more money outta the game, and they weren&#039;t all over it?

Will Blizzard be able to keep pointing the finger at the evil gold selling chinese farmers and saying, &quot;they are to blame for the economy!&quot; in face of this?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[New WoW patch=nobody cares :-)

Most of us left wow after hitting 60 long ago. I&#039;ve been to EQ2 and now Matrix Online since. WoW was an incredibly awesome game and I think it has been the MMOG made to date, including all of them starting with UO-onward. But it quit being fun so fast. Who knew?

					<description><![CDATA[I was on last night and was lag-a-riffic almost everywhere.  Guinness-eligible lag in IF, of course.  So I was going to gripe about that, and especially that bullshit with mana regen, but wanted to climb aboard for the SonyBay hubub first.

Fear not.  There is much griping to be had still.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What no comments about the new WoW patch? I guess you haven&#039;t had time to check it out, but I figured your guildies would have said something to you.

Honor system = Massive Lag due to Raids

griping abounds on the forums of course]]></description>
