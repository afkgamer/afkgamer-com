					<description><![CDATA[Korean players must be moonlighting from Lineage2 to be in GW. I have a friend who knew some mandarin which was nice in Lineage to get the everpresent farmers off our back. 

The cinematic is ok once, more than that I will be hitting &quot;skip&quot; myself every few times. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What Anon said - that&#039;s Hangul, an alphabet for representing Korean.  I guess it could represent pretty much any language.

Back when I was playing FFXI, you&#039;d get Japanese text on occasion, if you were partied with a Japanese player or happened to look at a Japanese player&#039;s player description text.  The real hardcore FFXI players would go through the trouble of learning key Japanese phases in romanji (Japanese spelled out in the Latin alphabet), so they could apologize profusely when they screwed up and got the Japanese player killed.

					<description><![CDATA[3 level 60&#039;s? OMG HAWTTY.

Anywho - no nothing&#039;s wrong with your display, those are the characters used in the Korean language (not that I can read any of it, just recognize that it *is* Korean).

Kinda annoying that that pops up though - as if Sir IPoopedMyself didn&#039;t screw with immersion enough.]]></description>
