					<description><![CDATA[It only took the EQ2 Trial of the Isle thing to steer me clear of EQ2.  I was already into WoW but I figured what the hell and tried it out.  Ten minutes into the game I wanted the hell off the boat away from the annoying talking pirate captain and his people.  I wasn&#039;t much more impressed once I got onto the island.  People have told me before, &quot;Well that&#039;s just the trial demo thingy which is just the newbie part of the game. Once you play the real game it&#039;s a lot better&quot;.  The thing is that I was amazed by WoW when I turned it on for the first time and walked around in newbie land rather than being pissed off by the newbie area.  If the Trial of the Isle was inteded to do something else than annoy me, well then they need to make a new version of it so that you are just utterly amazed and cannot do anything but pull your credit card out and make a purchase.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I will not say never.  But, EQ2 had a rough start ... word of mouth wise ... which had nothing to do, really, with the Sony branding.  That put it at the bottom of my list of things to buy/try.  I can&#039;t buy every game, so if a bunch of e-friends say, &quot;i heard it sucks&quot;, I kinda go with that.

Stupid way to judge a game I don&#039;t have and didn&#039;t beta, I know, but that&#039;s my system.  I know a lot of positive changes have gone in since release, so again, I won&#039;t say never.  :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Biased opinion: EQ2 is very good. Don&#039;t pass up a chance to at least try it. I&#039;m serious, it really is good and I think it&#039;s only derided because of the negative brandpower that SOE is carrying around right now.

I didn&#039;t make it past day 1 of Guild Wars. It&#039;s a beautifully bland world. I decided I&#039;d rather spend my time defending Tarren Mill and building a necro in EQ2.]]></description>
