					<description><![CDATA[heh, bet you wish you could go back and edit that, huh?  ;)

Some sources say the plural form is shaman.  I&#039;m willing to concede that whatever the hell someone wants to use for multiple shaman is ok with me.  Usually I use .. wtf and dammit when in their vicinity.

EDIT:  Also, I use to pronounce necromancers as NEE-cromancers and shaman as SHAY-man, until I was corrected YEARS LATER on TeamSpeak.  So it&#039;s clear that I&#039;m no expert in arcane lore and terminology.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ahh Alts-Anonymous - love that.  :)

What&#039;s even funnier is listening in on the Barrens chat - prime example of the blind leading the blind.

So cute (PvE server here too) when Alliance hits Xroads, and some ambitious teen-level Horde tries to drum up a raid to &quot;retaliate at Astranaar!&quot;  

Shine on you crazy diamond.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Some players are freaking addicted to alts. They never max-level anything, just screw around with one of their 8 or 10 characters until even they, themselves, realize they&#039;re an embarassment to the guild.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hmm, that is so like me it is frightening.]]></description>
