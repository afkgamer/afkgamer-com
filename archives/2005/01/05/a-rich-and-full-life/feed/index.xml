					<description><![CDATA[I have the job, the wife, the 2 kids. At the end of the day I have 2 or 3 hours for gaming, provided I don&#039;t want to do anything else. Such as: surf the web, read a book, watch TV, go for a walk, etc. The gaming is always the lowest priority, yet I spend way too much time thinking about playing when I can&#039;t. I feel like I have a full and rewarding life.

My brother is on the other end of the spectrum. He puts in over 240 hours of gaming every month. That is roughly 8 hours a day. He has a job, but no wife and no kids. Sleep, work, game. Is that a full life? Not in my world.]]></description>
