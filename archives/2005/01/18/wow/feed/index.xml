					<description><![CDATA[I am with Foton here.  Do server splits to brand new servers.  That would be far superior to splitting off to low/med pop servers.  Then the low/med servers become high and have queues then they have to ro more transfers...etc...

All they will be doing if they do that is spreading the problem to more servers.  

BAD IDEA Blizz!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Immitating solutions that have worked for others in the past is all very good, but it won&#039;t happen overnight. They&#039;d really lodge it up their arse if they break the game more with their fix, oh, say, loseing items etc during their server change.

Right now, the numbers that that are looking at, are how many people have gone one their their monthly payments, and those people will be around for a while, and how many people are approaching the end of their free trial. I&#039;d wadger that last number is rather high and a few people are pissing their pants right now.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The way the mods are talking on the forums, sounds like they&#039;re going to offer to move high-pop characters to selected low/med-pop servers.  (like maybe mine -- DOH!)

Which isn&#039;t really good news for those that enjoy a low/med-pop server .. a sudden influx of level 40+s, instead of slower, steady growth?  Ouch.

Why not offer server splits to brand, spanking new servers?  Why the hell don&#039;t these people see what has worked for other games (or hasn&#039;t worked) and use past experiences as their guide?  That&#039;s kinda where I&#039;m getting this fucking arrogance thing.

Christ, learn from others&#039; mistakes.  Isn&#039;t that something we all learn at least by our 20s?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think Blizzard tried a few things in order to &quot;Boldly go where no gaming company has gone before&quot;.  Some of these things look great on paper but in reality suck ass.

The P2P patching system is an example.  Sure it takes less of Blizzard&#039;s bandwidth but it is woefully inadequate for the scope and mass of this game.  They just need to knuckle up and buy the necessary bandwidth and scrap the P2P patch system.

The queues are designed to keep the servers within operating limits.  They want to make sure lag is minimal and to do that they need to insure the load is within certain parameters.  They don&#039;t want to limit server populations because that would be EXTREMELY difficult to do.  Since at times the server would be peaked and at others there would be wasted utilization.

I think the soluition is pretty straight forward.  Do what Evercrack did.  Split server populations.  Do character transfers.  Many will jump for a low population server.  In EQ I have seen entire guilds go over.  This does require buying more servers and despite the sales and subscription money they may not yet be liquid enough to outlay that kind of cash.

I think they will eventually get a handle on these problems.  The big question is how soon?  If they take too long they will lose customers.  If they rush too quickly they could make the problem worse.  It&#039;s a delicate balance.  I hope they get it under control quickly.

I had an hour+ wait last night to log in.  A guildie logged in then got booted and had to wait again.  Now that is the suck of all suckiness.

BTW...Nice site I always get a good chuckle when I read this site.  I thought I was the only sane person in MMOGs.  Nice to see other pockets of sanity out there.]]></description>
