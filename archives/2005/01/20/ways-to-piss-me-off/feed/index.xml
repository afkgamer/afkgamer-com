					<description><![CDATA[Oh, I did that quest easily. I was camping the trolls to get fangs for a warrior-only quest (Cyclonian). Being already 40 killing them was easy and I gathered there most of the pages.

Then I checked the AH and bought directly the four pages I was still missing (spending 60 silver or so and exactly one page for each chapter, I believe the system blatantly cheats).

Instead I&#039;m a completist type in WoW, I do all the quests I find no matter of the reward. Often I spend many hours to finish grey quests that I still haven&#039;t done.

And yes, I&#039;m heading to level 43 and still 20 gold away from my mount. My bags are 10-slot.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Re: STV pages
My guild actually got the bright idea of having a designated mule for the pages.  Everyone sent in all pages they recieved, to free up inventory space, and send requests for full chapters.  That way, you got all of it quested out at once AND you didn&#039;t have carry shit around.  Good idea, overall.  A whole 30c to cover mailing costs &amp; having a guildmate who wants to manage it [at least the damn things stack].  We did it, and we only have about 10-15 really active members.
But yes, doing the quest solo w/o guild support sucks ass through a straw.]]></description>
