		<p>You remember <a href="https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/archives/2005/01/27/they-will-overcome/">the warrior march</a> on the Argent Dawn server scheduled for tonight?</p>
<p>You probably don&#8217;t.  No matter, go read up on it, we have time.  *pours another strong one*</p>
<p>Anyhoo, I&#8217;m coming to you live from the Argent Dawn tea party.  I had made a character on Argent Dawn a few days ago, because ffs, I didn&#8217;t want to get banned.  So I logged in tonight, quietly, INNOCENTLY, reporting in as a rogue in support of my warrior brethren.</p>
<p>In the five minutes that I was logged on, this is what happened:</p>
<p>I was kicked from the game.  I said nothing, I did nothing.  There was a GM announcement and I was summarily kicked from the game.  (pussies)</p>
<p>Obviously, screenshots will follow &#8230;  Attempting to login again &#8230;</p>
<p>**UPDATE01**  I&#8217;m like flipping CNN in Baghdad &#8230; Got back in to Argent Dawn.  No GM in evidence althought the Warrior-created guild is now bugged so they can&#8217;t invite others to the guild.  They are about to begin the march to Ironforge.  It is a sea of naked gnomery, and I cannot adequately describe how horrifying a vision that is.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s curious to me.  All the Argent Dawn residents that are spitting and cursing at our warrior brethren for choosing a peaceful march on Ironforge as their form of protest when &#8230; NONE OF THE AD RESIDENTS even had to be in the zone.  Yet, many are here.  They are using the general chat channel and /yell to taunt the warriors.  </p>
<p>This indicates that the residents made some effort to be here.  If they are so disinterested and against this nonviolent march, why are they here?  Is this their counter-protest?  More to follow &#8230;</p>
<p><span id="more-252"></span>**UPDATE01A**  Well dammit, while I was typing Update01, I was kicked off the server.  Do you see why I need an intern or an assistant of some sort??  &#8230; checking on the status &#8230;</p>
<p> **UPDATE02**  There are at least 5 characters named Nurfed or Nerfed or Nerfmemore, and so I asked &#8230; Cosmik, is that you?  I was checking to see if some legit press was in attendance or if it was just me, Champion of NeoGamingJournalism, in attendance.  I didn&#8217;t get to hear a response before I was booted again from the server.  So Cosmik, if that was you &#8230; &#8220;werd.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, there are many, many fem gnomes with pink pigtails.  This was disturbing to me.</p>
<p>Trying to login again &#8230; </p>
<p>**UPDATE03**  Well, I tried to walk (walk, not run) from the dirf start area to Ironforge.  I was ALMOST there, and was discussing Tiananmen Square with an Argent Dawn resident when I got kicked again.  Now c&#8217;mon, I realize that Tiananmen Square and a Warcrack protest have almost nothing in common except this:  all protesters are called kooks and mocked for their beliefs.  Which is cool.  </p>
<p>I said already, I&#8217;m a big fan of the protest.  From a &#8220;Chaos is Fun&#8221; point of view, and also not much gets changed without someone saying, &#8220;this shit ain&#8217;t right.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Trying to login again &#8230;  (oh yes, I have plenty of screenshots) &#8230; </p>
<p>**UPDATE04** heh, the last thing I read before <em>this</em> disconnect was &#8230; HELL NO, WE WON&#8217;T GO.  Well, what a day, what a release, what a protest this has been.  Right before I was disco&#8217;d this time, there was a server going down message.  And hey, that&#8217;s always a valid choice.  Don&#8217;t bother with the fucking spin, go for taking the ball away.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s all cool, man.</p>
<p>The last screenshots I got were of dozens (was it hundreds?  No one can know because the guild invite was inoperative &#8230; mysteriously &#8230; after they had many in the guild.  Couldn&#8217;t get the full story from the protest leader as we both kept getting the disco.) &#8230; so let&#8217;s just say &#8230; dozens (OR MORE) gnomes jumping and dancing on the Ironforge bridge.</p>
<p>For the record, there were never any GM announcements other than the ones I screenshot prior to the scheduled protest time.</p>
<p>Trying to relog &#8230;  more to follow &#8230; (you can&#8217;t get this kind of News You Can&#8217;t Use on the better blogs) &#8230;</p>
<p>**UPDATE05** Ok, I&#8217;m back in, and curiously, I&#8217;m back outside of Ironforge and have to recomplete my laborious walk to the IF bridge.  GODDAMIT, who do I have to **** to get a mount in this game?  Is it a pally?</p>
<p>&#8230; more will follow &#8230;</p>
<p>**UPDATE06** omg omg, there&#8217;s an actual GM character here now in Ironforge near the bridge.  In 50-some levels, I have <em>never</em> seen an actual GM character EVER in this game.  </p>
<p>This is me after I see the GM dude:  umm, does anyone know where the auction house is in this city?  (because I&#8217;m behind a good protest, but I&#8217;m not willing to give up 50-some levels for somebody else&#8217;s class.)</p>
<p>And I&#8217;d say, also, that &#8230; CURIOUSLY, but maybe it&#8217;s innocently &#8230; there are almost no gnomes left now.  As I said, I made a dwarf.  Before, there were at least 100 gnomes.  Now, there&#8217;s 2 on the bridge.  Could be coincidence, if you&#8217;re the kind that believes in that.  Could be not.</p>
<p>&#8230; more to come &#8230;</p>
<p>**UPDATE07** PROTEST DOWN!  PROTEST DOWN!  GM Xan-something (was it Xanax?  that would be deliciously ironic) said that all level one gnome warriors would have their accounts suspended if they didn&#8217;t logoff post-haste.  Cuz y&#8217;know, fuck the spin, they&#8217;re bringing out the big guns to deal with this shit.</p>
<p>To sum up, before the I post the dozens of screenshots (sans names, because you won&#8217;t find Foton aiding and abetting The Man in banning people for speaking their mind in a very colorful and entertaining way), the protest had an impact.  Passions were inflamed.  Obviously, the power of the pen (as it were) is invoked.</p>
<p>Several Argent Dawn residents queried if MLK, Jr would be ashamed.  As they proposed, there is Protest, and there is protest.  Nothing less will do.</p>
<p>I would disagree.  I think every great protester would agree that he/she never understood another&#8217;s position, yet recognized their zeal to protest.  Of course, the warrior plight in Warcraft is NOTHING in the sum of things.  </p>
<p>And yet.  And yet.  And yet.</p>
<p>And yet, if we all agree that the power of the pen is nothing &#8230; if we all agree that protest means nothing &#8230; if we all turn our backs on anothers&#8217; plight &#8230; are we part of the solution?  Or are we part of the problem?</p>
<p>Ya, I realize, warriors in Warcraft are nothing.  But, I&#8217;m a big fan of the Boston Tea Party.  </p>
<p>Y&#8217;see, protests put it all in your face.  You decide.  Is it Jihad, in a very &#8220;I hate America because they can feed everyone 233 times over&#8221; kind of way?  Or, is it maybe something that deserves some (any) attention?</p>
<p>Because, fuck.  When a group of people take the time to organize and march, I dunno &#8230; I pay attention.  Passion is so rare in this time and age.  They love your game.  They want to love it more.  They want to love it completely.  Apparently, there&#8217;s a problem here.  </p>
<p>Passion, it&#8217;s so rare.  Seems a shame to waste it.</p>

<p>Btw, I&#8217;m currently banned ;p The message tells me to check my e-mail but they sent nothing till now.</p>

<p>This is again an old topic that was debated not long ago when the players were &#8220;ported on space&#8221; during the well-known protest on SWG, but I still point out that a protest or a strike, like in real life, have to produce a disservice.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>You fought the good fight, bro.  I&#8217;ll risk a level 20 character, but I won&#8217;t risk 50 levels.  I can be bought and sold like that.  🙂</p>
<p>Seriously, I admired the warriors&#8217; passion.  I know one of the guildmates played a warrior in Beta to the upper 50s and loved it.  The late-beta nerfs drove him insane.  Well, something drove him insane.  We&#8217;re willing to believe it was the nerfs.</p>
<p>At any rate, anyone that spends even a short amount of time in online gaming goes through a big nerf personally, and it&#8217;s never pretty.  To be promised otherwise and then swallow delay after delay &#8230; well, let&#8217;s just hope the rogues, pallies and shamen never have to experience this, because there&#8217;s 95% of the players, right there.</p>
