					<description><![CDATA[This one time at quest camp....


Seriously though.  I have had pretty good luck so far with the quests I have done...The key to Deep Ocean, Vast Sea is to find some other group of chumps doing the quest and follow them through.  They&#039;ll clear the bulk of the mobs and then you swoop in and grab what ya gotta grab!

Now my question has to do with some of the other logistics.  Like I did the quest where you have to kill Otto and Lord Falconbreas...err Falconcrest.  Otto is his body guard but Otto is 2 levels under him and is FAR easier to kill.  Why does Otto still have this job?  I mean if I am going to hire a bodyguard I want one who is tougher then me.  That would be like hiring a bunch of scrawny people to protect the president....heyyyy, I might be on to something there!  But I digress!

It just seems some quests defy logic.  DAMN YOU FUROR!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[heh.  I&#039;ve never leveled in the &lt;strike&gt;dark&lt;/strike&gt; night elf area, but I hear ya, bro.  I&#039;m willing to blame Furor for that quest also. 

I&#039;m sure your story will spawn legions of tales about the &quot;quests designed by the psycho fired dude.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know the feeling well. There&#039;s the Deep Ocean, Vast Sea quest north of Auberdine that has you diving into a boat to extract 2 items for some dwarf in town.

Only, you have to do it while getting swarmed by tons of level 14 - 16 Murlocs. The Murlocs have stun, hit rapidly, have lightning shield, and heal themselves. And unless you&#039;re a Warlock or have a Waterbreathing potion, you&#039;re having to cope with all that while also worrying about drowning. 

A more obnoxious combination of quest obsticals would be hard to come up with. The quest is rated level 17, but I&#039;ve seen duo&#039;s of level 23 go in there to get chewed up and spit back out like so much fish food.

Talking to a friend of mine that worked on WoW, I griped about that quest in particular. He told me that the designer that had made that quest was notorious within the company for making awful quests and that he had been let go before the end of the project. 

I&#039;ve mentioned this to all my friends that have likewise found that quest excessively annoying. So of course, now whenever our group encounters an unrewarding, difficult, or obnoxious quest, someone inevitably conjectures that this quest was also designed by the one responsible for Deep Ocean, Vast Sea.

By my count, that would make the guy solely responsible for about one tenth the game content.
