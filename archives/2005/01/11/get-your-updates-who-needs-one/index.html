		<p>Recall yesterday&#8217;s post about the creeps:  the omnipresent Lolys and the (in his own mind) omnipotent Blizzard employee.  </p>
<p>Update on &#8220;oh how I wish we were real life friends&#8221; Nebu:  Late yesterday, Blizzard reps post the results of the Monday meetings regarding Nebu&#8217;s continuing antics.  And when I use a plural for meetings, I mean just that.  I just know that shit took more than one meeting.  Quoting, because Warcraft message boards have a &#8230; how to say? &#8230; proclivity to lose <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-general&#038;t=746186&#038;p=1&#038;tmp=1#post746186">forum posts</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the weekend, a thread was posted on the Tichondrius realm forum warning Horde players of certain guilds and characters they should look out for while adventuring. This thread contained information on a Blizzard employee&#8217;s guild, and conjecture was made on which character that employee played. This thread was deleted, and all subsequent threads created on this topic were closed. Several other threads containing references to this guild were also deleted, and a few players were wrongly suspended or banned from the forums for participating in these threads. We would like to correct this mistake. If you feel you were wrongly banned or suspended from the forums, please email your character name and the name of the realm you play on to wowreportedpost@blizzard.com. Furthermore, please note that we are taking measures to ensure this does not happen again.</p>
<p>We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this caused and thank you for your understanding and patience.</p>
<p>In addition, as part of our normal name-review process, the aforementioned guild&#8217;s name was reviewed last week and was found to be in violation of World of Warcraft&#8217;s naming policy. The name violates the rule dealing with real-world references, and is subject to the same procedure as other guilds. Therefore, the guild will be disbanded and reimbursed for their tabard, and will have to re-form using a different name. Please note that these are two separate issues that have the unfortunate coincidence of requiring attention at the same time.</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-219"></span>Well, that&#8217;s cool.  I mean, what can they say?  I&#8217;d guess the meeting went something like this:  Umm, gee.  I really don&#8217;t want to come in to work Monday morning and find out that our employees have been playing High School Cliques 4TW with our customer base, so if you can&#8217;t keep it zipped up (and I do mean IT zipped up), then you best look for work elsewhere.</p>
<p>Really, the above Blizz post is the best possible spin they could have put on it, so until the next drama (and I think we can all agree that there will be more drama courtesy of the Neb-ster), let&#8217;s put this one to bed.</p>
<p>Now back to the accused Chinese-farming Lolys.  I did a little research on my own server, which I will not name here, mostly because it&#8217;s not fair to specifically identify people (even if they are Chinese farmers) when they have no chance of defending themselves.</p>
<p>I looked up all the blue and purple auctions on the Auction House and noted those sellers with an abundance of items.  (For the cheap seats, blue and purple items are rare and epic items, respectively.  Read:  expensive.)  Not so coincidentally, one of those sellers is the one selling that demon bag that I&#8217;ve been auction camping for the past four or so days.  (See <a href="https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/archives/2005/01/09/screenshot-sunday/">Sunday&#8217;s post</a> &#8212; I even screenshot it.)   Which, by the way, is a very &#8230; nice &#8230; item.  That bitch isn&#8217;t worth 100 gold, but it&#8217;s worth plenty.</p>
<p>So, I put the Loly-types on my friends list to do a little virtual stalking.  As luck would have it, one of my regular hunting friends was going to be on all last night (no work for him today), so he stalked them also.  I&#8217;m dedicated to gaming neo-journalism; I&#8217;m just not real zealous about it.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s four players that qualified under my sorta-scientific selection criteria &#8212; all level 60s, either paladins or rogues.  Now, either these level 60s are incredible catassers, the likes of which I have never seen before in ten years of online gaming, or they&#8217;re professional farmers.  For you Warcraft noobs, there really isn&#8217;t an end game per se yet, so I&#8217;ll allow that there isn&#8217;t much else for the level 60s  to do except farm, but CMON &#8230; WoW farming isn&#8217;t so interesting and absorbing that one would spend 24/7 doing it.</p>
<p>Which is exactly the Loly-types&#8217; behavior for the past 36 hours of stalking:  occasional logouts for  two or three minutes, then the Loly-types are back online.</p>
<p>Next, I was cruising through Ironforge and stopped off to check the Auction House.  Of course, I checked on the demonbag trinket.  How that auction has worked the past few days is the Loly-seller has it up at a 30 gold minimum, he/she/it lets the auction time dwindle down to an hour or so remaining, then pulls the auction and relists it.  Now I know the Loly-seller has gotten bids over the minimum as several acquaintances and I have all bid on it, only to be turned away at the last minute.</p>
<p>That makes no sense at all.  If Loly-seller wants more than 35 or so gold for the trinket, then goddamn list it for more than that.  Is that so hard to understand?  I&#8217;d like to buy it, but I&#8217;m not smoking crack and I won&#8217;t pay 100 gold for the bitch.</p>
<p>I checked on the demonbag, it had about 30 minutes left on the auction and, BOO YA, the Loly-seller came to the zone (what a shock) and auctioned the demonbag in the trade channel.</p>
<p>I offered five gold in a /tell.  (heh)  Loly-seller replied:  90G ok.  (I shit you not.)</p>
<p>I told him/her/it, &#8220;if you want 90g for the b*, then list it for that instead of pulling the auction and restarting every day.&#8221;  (B* and F* are my new and improved ways to curse without fear of perma-banning.)</p>
<p>No response and the Loly-seller fled Ironforge post-haste.</p>
<p>Why no response?  Why the quick flight out?  Why always in the Farm Zone?  Why always online?  Why the perpetual auction on the trinket?  Why is it, once again, listed at the max auction time?</p>
<p>Inquiring minds want to know.</p>
