					<description><![CDATA[Oddly my level 58 Priest has only gotten 5 unsolicited non-guild invites from since level 1. Four of those since level 44. So I don&#039;t think things are as dire as people say (at least not on Alliance/Silver Hand). Players get by just fine at the highest instances with two Paladins or a Paladin and Druid, the latter combo often claimed to be &lt;i&gt;superior&lt;/i&gt; to the traditional EQ-like Warrior+Priest(Cleric).

But, that said, I agree. The higher instances and raids become more and more EQ-like as you approach 60. Blizzard invited many members from top EQ raiding guilds into Alpha and they have at least several staff from the same, or similar, EQ guilds. Blame them and the folks at Blizzard who listened to them instead of the rest of the Alpha/Beta testers ... except when it came to Warriors and (Disc/Holy) Priests. The masses were listened to in those cases, nerfed them, and now Blizz can truly say that you don&#039;t need Warriors and Priests in the high-level instances. &quot;See? We&#039;re not EQ!&quot;
