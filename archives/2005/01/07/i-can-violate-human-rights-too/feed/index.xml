					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s so easy to get jaded in MMOGs. Sounds like your friend has JGS (Jaded Gamer Syndrome) something bad. All it takes is one bad comment by someone and they are permanently labled as &quot;not worth the time&quot; and are placed on &quot;the list&quot; as you say.

I think you were right to want to allow the guy one more chance. Sometimes that is enough to turn someone (who also might be suffering from JGS) over to the good side. Some of my best in-game friends have off nights, bad nights, things that pissed them off to cause them to be an ass. If I didn&#039;t already know them, they may well have been put on my own list that night.

We are all getting jaded, and are all becoming assholes because of it. He&#039;s on your list, your on his list. It&#039;s a downward spiral.]]></description>
