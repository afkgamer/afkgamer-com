					<description><![CDATA[RE:  Cecil -- How crazy hard is it to level in EQ2 that a guy would hold onto his character after the rep is so thoroughly trashed?  I know EQ you&#039;d have to do some serious thinking before ditching a char and remaking, (and I mean a 50+ char, NOT a level 39 fcs), but damn -- sometimes you have to cut bait and start over.

Of course, not making a complete jackass of yourself in the first place would be a good idea.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s funny.  Just yesterday I was remembering &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedauntless.com/cecil.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cecilantas &lt;/a&gt; and his EQ2 antics.  The guy who snapshotted the whole thing was right.  If you just expose the whole thing, it kinda blows over.  If you sneak out bits and let the guy dig his grave, it will become a historical marker in everyone&#039;s mind.  Poor Cecilantas (not!).]]></description>
