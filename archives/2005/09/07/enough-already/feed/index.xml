					<description><![CDATA[Yep, funny the first dozen times.  But like most things internet related, it leaves it&#039;s home base (WoW) and continues to fester in other places.  Last night, I was playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dayofdefeat.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Day of Defeat&lt;/a&gt; to ease the stress of everything that&#039;s been going on the past two week and who do I see on the server other than good ole Leeroy.  When you find the Leeroy plague invading other games, you know it&#039;s time to for it to die.  But it never will.  It will just continue to fester.  You&#039;ll be sitting on your deathbed in the hospital 60 years from now and the doctor will come into the room shouting &quot;Leeeeeroooooy!&quot;.  Just pull the plug now.]]></description>
