					<description><![CDATA[the most famous scammer on my server got banned ~3 months ago.

Multiple other wannabes got banned/suspended.

Usually not because of scamming (Blizzard is not taking action as far as i know) but because of bad language.

If you accuse them in IF yell, sooner or later they start swearing back, thats the time to call in the cavalry]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Odd choice of a player name, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pol_Pot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pol Pot&lt;/a&gt;.  And not disallowed by the naming filter either, obviously.  Wild stuff.

Ya, probably nothing done.  But MAYBE!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I reported a farmer, a scammer, and a nice fellow named Polpot. Got a nice email saying they&#039;d take care of it all three times. Added the three of them to friends list and they&#039;ve all been on daily ever since. 

Nothing will be done.]]></description>
