					<description><![CDATA[If we&#039;re thinking of the same interview, that was the guy that didn&#039;t hire (in a guild sense) women because the whole man/woman thing caused too many problems.  I knew where he was coming from, but honestly, I can&#039;t blame all that on chicks.  Just as likely it&#039;s the guys causing the problems.

And I agree with his points that you cite above, although, there&#039;s a subtle, yet important, difference between hardc0r3 and catass.  Burnout is a real factor, ESPECIALLY in those classes that lend themselves to sacrifice.  And I don&#039;t mean Lifetap.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmm there was an interview with one of the leaders of an &#039;uber&#039; guild, and he claimed that the hardest to find and important attributes were:
  - the ability to work for the team, to follow the orders you are given to the letter, not to piss about
  - the ability to regularly log on and participate in guild activities. 
  He mentioned that the more catassed were actually quite unreliable and tend to burn out quicker, and thus were not good guildies.]]></description>
