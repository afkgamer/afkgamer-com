					<description><![CDATA[white background extends all the way for me in FF 1.0.6.

I can imagine that would look really annoying to you.  :)

try a forced refresh?  (ctrl F5)  otherwise, hell if i know.

BUT!  I do see goofiness in IE related to a div issue.  (what. a. shock.)

Bleh, now I see it.  Couldn&#039;t because I was logged in under FF.  *calls in the intern!*

Known issue -- discussion &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/groups/binarybonsai/discuss/83605/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (for my reference)

(Again for my reference, IE sidebar fix &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/groups/binarybonsai/discuss/76285/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; -- r73 was supposed to have IE fix included, maybe didn&#039;t make it into release or didn&#039;t work.)

Temp fix:  changed backgrounds to white, no one&#039;s the wiser.  
Temp fix 2:  stepped back to r60, appears correct in FF and IE (with search bar out of place in IE).

Fix ID&#039;d for next RC (div issues with .commentauthor)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nono, layout wise.  Look at this page in IE, then look at it in FF.  The white BG + green border ends at the title of the blog post.  It does not extend downward to cover the entire post and the comments.  It&#039;s probably a div tag height issue.  IE doesn&#039;t care, but FF does.  I think.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hiding To Do list here, plus I can test commenting.  (I so clever.)

&lt;del&gt;Tag plugin&lt;/del&gt;
&lt;del&gt;Recent comments in sidebar&lt;/del&gt;
&lt;del&gt;Archives page - ELA&lt;/del&gt; (goddamn, those are slick!)
&lt;del&gt;Favatars not working for comments&lt;/del&gt;
&lt;del&gt;Header graphic of some sort.  (what to steal, what to steal ... Maxell, I have you now!)&lt;/del&gt;
&lt;del&gt;Cuss out guild anyway cuz this shit is taking WAY too long&lt;/del&gt;
Noteworthy plugin (to come in next RC)
Get a ban stick ready for anyone that rags about the color scheme
&lt;del&gt;Blockquote problem in comments (dammit, it&#039;s always something)&lt;/del&gt;
&lt;del&gt;Search link on back pages + custom sidebars ... err, maybe&lt;/del&gt;
&lt;del&gt;Asides graphics&lt;/del&gt;
&lt;del&gt;Word count to archive page (because more is always better)&lt;/del&gt;
WTF is up with fancy tooltips now?]]></description>
