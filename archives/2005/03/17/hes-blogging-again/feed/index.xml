I&#039;ve done the drunken cussout myself.  Never deguilded tho, but that was more of a matter of impaired spelling than not being willing to deguild.  Y&#039;know ... /guidlremov /guldremove /guildemove ... awww screw it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[haha, you should of said, &quot;not yet, m .. u... s.. t.. update...... bloooooooog. Oh sorry guys, wait... this will only take a few.&quot;

/writer&#039;s hat. 

You&#039;re speaking on TS while doing the update. 

&#062; Sometimes your forced to play with a bigger asshat than the typical maligant dickweed that ranks right up there on the fanboydom rung of the WoW forums. I would love to kick this mother ... in the nuts, but we need a warrior, so we let him tag along. How&#039;s that update sound guys?

Maybe you could of triggered something, &quot;Fuck you, Foton. It&#039;s all about your precious blog taking priority over your friends! Dammit, I need too reach the cap asap so I can sit on my ass read your damn blog. Tab your ass back into the game.&quot;

Hell yea, you should defnitely try afk drunken gaming sometime if you haven&#039;t already, I&#039;ve done it a few times myself. Without a doubt, you know you&#039;re beyond jaded when your craving some booze to get through the grind. One of my most serious fuckups is when I deguilded and cussed out my guild leader totally shit faced drunk, all in GU for that matter. It was sad, but man it was comedy gold. I woke up the next day and was in the &quot;oh snap,&quot; state of mind, logged in, character naked, guildless, a crap load tells asking what the hell was my problem from the night before. Nothing like your very own mmo happy hour.
