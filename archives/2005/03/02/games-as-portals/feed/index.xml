					<description><![CDATA[Ya, AO did this a long time ago, over a year? I remember seeing the billboards for Notum Wars and thought &quot;ok, it&#039;s only a matter of time&quot;, and it was..  Unlike the other tards that might do adverts in-game though, AO did it with class, it wasn&#039;t offensive, and just came off as &quot;cool&quot;.. There it was, a billboard display for Alienware computers.. Fit right in!!
Damn you AO for not upgrading your graphics last year while you were doing the Alien Invasion action.. Damn that game had/has some of the coolest environments.. The Shadowlands zones are freaking beauty, and as I created a new character to play there I thought, damn, *still* using these same low-poly faces?? Let&#039;s meld CoH&#039;s char-creation/detail, bubblechat and smoothness with AO&#039;s concepts and world.. Huzzah!]]></description>

Have you considered a future in marketing?  heh, I know you were being facetious, but those ideas aren&#039;t bad.

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;!-- spamk    : Comment text: &#039;I can see it now...in game commercials, discounts and even spam in your game mailbox.  How about camping the Uber Free Pizza coupon that drops once every 8 hours from a random mob?  I can hear the Ninja Loot cries as we speak!

You walk up to a merchant right click on him and buy food just like you buy arrows.  It charges whatever CC you use to pay your subscription with and BAM!  BOOM! You got food/drink!
