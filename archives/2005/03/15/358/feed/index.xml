					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, Duh.  Go flaunt your ignorance somewhere that it is appreciated like perhaps &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/board.aspx?fn=wow-general&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;WoW General Forums&lt;/a&gt;.  I usually dislike stupid people but I&#039;ll help you out on this one.  After downloading the last tiny patch, which yes did actually come from a Blizzard server, I installed WoW on another machine I had in my house and the one cumulative patch that was downloaded did come from Shittorrent since it was huge because it was everything from GA release to present day.  So it looks like they have interim patches for tiny 1-up patching (like the internationalization patch) which they put on some Blizzard server and cumulative patches for really big patches or for the poor saps who buy the product new off the shelves which they put on Shittorrent (btw, there are plenty of copies of WoW left in Texas at stores).

Seeing as this will be a motherload of goodies (and not-so-goodies as well; thanks for another nutsack-kicking for Warlocks, Blizz) it will likely be very big.  My guild also has a plan (so sad that we need this).  I have a Fileplanet and Allakhazam account so I&#039;ll be grabbing the patch come patch day and plopping it on our guild server so our members don&#039;t have to wait for 5 hours after they get home from work to play.

					<description><![CDATA[Y&#039;know, this reminds me of a story that guildmate CPADude told us the other day.  

His firm sent out a mailing from a new office they opened up near a gated senior community about the tax prep, financial planning and estate planning services they offered.

Tasteful mailing, one page with a response card if people were interested.  As he tells the story, some of the responses were quite salty. One guy took the time to cover the response card in &quot;Fuck You&#039;s&quot;; another wrote a typewritten letter about he wanted to ram his (ahem) into anyone&#039;s ass that sent him unsolicited mail; another guy sent his reply postage-due and included various anti-US govt slogans.  All unsigned, of course.

Apparently the seniors have a lot of time on their hands.

So, in the future, if you want to use my corner of the net to tell me I suck, have the nads to sign with your real name or nick and a real email.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/archives/2005/01/25/another-poorer-but-wiser-lesson/#comment-103&quot;&gt;Anything less&lt;/a&gt; just makes you a pussy, noob.]]></description>
