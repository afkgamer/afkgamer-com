					<description><![CDATA[Rather than more openness in the official forums in the future, I&#039;m betting that the upshot of this will be Tigole getting his wrist slapped by his bosses at Blizzard, if not worse.  What he tells his guildies in the future will be as underground and deniable as he can make it.

As a gamer, I want to know what&#039;s going to be in a patch in as much detail as possible, as far in advance as possible.  But as a developer I&#039;m all for limiting that sort of disclosure on products I&#039;m working on, just to keep my options open.  This way, if some of the items on the wish list for the patch turn out to be a little more difficult than first guessed, the blowback is minimized.  ]]></description>
