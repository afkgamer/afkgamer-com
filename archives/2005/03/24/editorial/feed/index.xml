					<description><![CDATA[Playing with numbers is fun.  So you say 13% is small.

Their last stat was 1.5 million subscribers right?

1.5mil * 13% = 195,000 subscribers, each of which pays 15$ a month.

195,000 * 15 = 2.925 million $ per month

That should be reason enough.

Add to that the negative press and word of mouth?  They can&#039;t afford to let these problems persist.

I&#039;m happy that you hit a flawless server Wreak, but I think you are looking through rose tinted glasses.  If you were on a shitty server you&#039;d be singing a different tune when you wipe and get disconnected while in an instance and can&#039;t log in for a half hour.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s great for you guys, but until they offer server transfers to all of the servers having problems or suffering from overpopulation, we&#039;re up shit creek.

As long as we&#039;re locked in, yeah, complaints will flow, like spice.

(I, like, commas.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Disclaimer: Written while drunk. Read at own risk.

Well, I gotta play the devil. Let&#039;s have it straight: I play on one of the flawless servers, those down only for regular maintenance and patches.

I have to consider what proportion of customers are getting this shitty deal. I&#039;ve never seen a queue in my life (as in, it was a novelty when that animated gif with the song underlay came out because i finally knew what the hell all these people kept screaming about). What is it, 10 out of 75 servers? Using my computer calculator to do the math (as in my current state I couldn&#039;t... remember kids, don&#039;t drink and drive, but drink and surf (intraweb) is A-ok), I get 13%.

13% measly percent... In terms of cars, the best cars (and I&#039;m talking about those that top of Consumer&#039;s Reports reliability scales, not the ones that are the sexiest), have about 80 problems per hundred cars within the first period (i can&#039;t remember whether this was a year or more). So translating this, let&#039;s say that the worse off servers have had about 5 major issues each (this is coming straight out of my a$$), that&#039;s 50/75, or 66%. Still better than those cars :) :) :)

While I agree that the server issues are a problem, I at least still have some faith that they will be resolved. Hopefully. No, really. Come on. 13.... 13%.....  They&#039;ve got to be able to fix that. Right? Right? I sure hope so. I think the situation may even be improving, but I can&#039;t tell from the screaming on worldofwarcraft.com/forums.

One thing is for sure. With this patch, they have done something I&#039;ve never seen any other MMO do this fast. They&#039;ve looked at custom UI&#039;s, and they&#039;ve taken the best aspects of them, the most commonly used, etc, and actually implemented them! ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t had any client issues.  But reliability of the servers is weak.  I guess I am an eternal optimist and I think that eventually (a year) down the road most of these kinks should be worked out.  

My server has been fairly blessed (not many queues, minimal down time, etc..) which isn&#039;t to say it has been trouble free.  I certainly can appreciate the frustration those on the troubled servers feel.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well now it&#039;s not only the servers that are screwed up; the client seems to have taken a hit with this patch as well. Everyone crashing about 90% of the time when rezzed (and then not being able to make it past the login server) is insane. Guess everyone is so buffed up on the test server that no one ever dies and has to be rezzed.

					<description><![CDATA[Sounds like someone hasn&#039;t read the EULA.

24/7 uptime is not only not guaranteed, it&#039;s specifically mentioned as not part of the deal.

Don&#039;t like that? Stop paying! Can I have your stuff?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So...was it the clutch? ;)

Actually, there&#039;s more mileage in that analogy if you frame it as a leased car, e.g., you don&#039;t actually own the car, you know you&#039;re only going to drive it for a couple of years before getting a new one, etc.  But there is no insurance and no residual value in the car when you&#039;re done with it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amen.  That&#039;s what I was trying to get at earlier, but betcha some putz will waltz in here and poke holes in the analogy - just because they can.

For the folks saying &quot;Not my server!&quot; - that&#039;s nice, consider yourself fortunate.  We were recommended certain servers on launch day (and several showed &quot;Low&quot; at that time), and some of us lost the &#039;Good Server Lottery.&#039;  That and not all of us on the servers of the damned have been offered server transfers yet.

For the folks saying &quot;You&#039;re just whiny old farts!&quot; - Ironically, you&#039;re whining about whining (oh, so am I, irony++!).  Hi, our venting doesn&#039;t affect you in any signifcant way, so please move along, stripling.]]></description>
