					<description><![CDATA[Wonder how long until the resellers become like organized crime and start offering &quot;protection&quot; services in exchange for some kickbacks.  They could be working on that &quot;deal you can&#039;t refuse&quot; right now in some shady San Francisco dive.

&quot;I believe in Gaming.  Gaming has made my fortune.&quot;  heh.

(That was a joke, but I would not be surprised at the lengths people will go when there&#039;s a lot of money involved.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You joke about the IGE thing, but at last year&#039;s Austin Game Conference they did almost literally what you describe, pasting up signs saying they were going to be at a conference room while it was unoccupied, implying that it was part of a &quot;customer service&quot; track.

Sadly I never got to talk to Mr. Jonathan Yantis, but I did spy him from across a room. It would have been an interesting conversation.]]></description>
