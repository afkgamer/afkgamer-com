					<description><![CDATA[I can understand why someone may not want to give their real name when dealing with such a situation. But they should still do it anyway. 

I work for a company that purchases loans from banks/mortgage companies/credit unions etc...Last year we bought billions of dollars worth of loans. If I mess up on a single loan or slack off (like posting on AFK) loans can go bad, lock dates can be blow through and thousands of dollars can be lost. Or, if there is fraud or misrep on loans, I get the pleasure of telling a mortgage company that they potentially now owe us millions of dollars. In such cases I do not call saying &quot;Hello this is Chef and we have a problem&quot;. 

Honestly if you are afraid of some basement dwelling nerd with a banned WoW account then perhaps you should be working as a photographer for a kitten calendar. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad that there was a semi-satisfactory resolution to this player&#039;s issue, but dang, Blizzard needs a clearer process that gives players the benefit of the doubt.  (Shut up Blizzard fundies.)  

If it&#039;s really a temp-lock pending investigation, call it that - don&#039;t slam the door and pretend there&#039;s no other way to contest it.  Loverly spin though.

					<description><![CDATA[Some gamers, way back when I was a Senior Guide in EQ, have threatened GMs and guides with RL harm for not helping with a simple issue.  Imagine the response of these same types when their accoutn is banned!   I think the use of character names in e-mails although technically unprofessional in a traditional sense helps to protect these people.  I mean really if you were going to piss off someone you thought was a hacker would you want them to have your RL name?  I wouldn&#039;t!

Personally I think in the gaming and entertainment community, cause lets face it games are entertainment, signing with an alias is just fine.  I mean would you rather have LL Cool J or James Smith sign your CD?

					<description><![CDATA[haha, I thought that too, especially about the Account Admin person.  Guess I can understand the Lead GM using a fake name just in case he has to get his hands dirty and work the petition queue, but the admin people?  Is working over there like going to a LARP every day?  Cuz that would drive me to drink.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Am I the only one who thinks it&#039;s funny that Blizzard employees use their fantasy nicknames when responding in a &quot;professional&quot; manner? How would you feel if your doctor signed prescriptions &quot;Sir Dragonslayer&quot; or somesuch? 

I have learned (through trial and error) that if one acts professionally, then one can be expect to be treated professionally. Bliz isn&#039;t the only gaming company guilty of this. For some reason MMO employees across the board really think that it&#039;s important to &quot;live the dream&quot;. No. They are there to provide a service, not have a good time. I honestly don&#039;t care if they are treated to EA like working conditions if it means that the servers stay up. ]]></description>
