					<description><![CDATA[In no way is this a method of fraud, the price is listed clearly - if you don&#039;t look closely you might suffer.  It is the same as legal &#039;fine print&#039; - ignore it at your own peril.

The problem is Blizzard&#039;s UI, which could easily display the prices in a more distinctive manner than a slight change in color - woe to the colorblind.

Nice.  Punish the player for problems with the game.

While WoW is certainly a huge success currently, I have significant doubts about its longevity.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah maybe the warning is too harsh.

I found a great addon for auctioning aptly named &quot;AuctionIt&quot; at http://www.curse-gaming.com/mod.php?addid=453 - it&#039;ll warn you on buyouts that are higher than you&#039;ve previously paid, keep track of your auction prices, etc.  Check it out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ya, I believe it is.  However, it is very easy to misprice your auctions with the current interface.  I mispriced an auction once -- fortunately, another player sent me a /tell asking if I intended to put such a ridiculous buyout on the auction.  I flew back to IF, redid the auction and he bought the items (forget what they were) and went on his merry way.  

Very difficult to determine intent when the interface is so sloppy, imo.  Although I am more careful when I put up auctions now since I made that error way back when.  Account warning seems heavy-handed to me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Come on, isn&#039;t that a totally common scam?  You make the bid price silver, and the buyout price gold hoping that high level characters with deep pockets will buyout without noticing the discrepancy.  When I was power-levelling my engineering and mining I was buying stacks upon stacks of ore, linen, and other common trade goods and about 10% of the people selling were doing this.]]></description>
