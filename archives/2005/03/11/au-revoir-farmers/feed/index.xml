					<description><![CDATA[I stand corrected!  &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-general&#038;t=1913432&#038;p=1&#038;tmp=1#post1913432&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The forums are now operational!&lt;/a&gt;

(And if there are any fanbois left, I know I&#039;m an asshole.  But, how hard is it to post a sticky saying that the boards are down and they don&#039;t know why and are working on it?  Ya.  Not hard at all.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Personally, I was hoping that the 1k banned accounts didn&#039;t include any false positives because the deafening din had died down on the boards.  O wait ... maybe that&#039;s because the boards have been broken for two (plus?) days now.  :)

Ya, I have concerns about the detective work also.  It&#039;s like they have Clouseau running the show over there.]]></description>
