					<description><![CDATA[WoW is a mixed bag: fantastic game with problematic support.

I&#039;m one of the 1.5 million players who love the game, yet repeatedly run into annoying support issues -- like the Menethil Harbor Auberdine boat disappearing while in the middle of the Great Sea.

Thought the problem was fixed, but support problems are as unpredictable as quest drops.  You know they&#039;ll occur &#039;eventually&#039; you just don&#039;t know when.

From an objective, logical perspective, the surest way to infuriate someone is to get between a gamer and their game.  Blizzard appears to have underestimated this.

But what Blizzard is banking on is the game itself will keep a large percentage of its subscribers, and add many new subscribers, despite its lags, crashes and bugs.

					<description><![CDATA[OK, I agree now. Blizzard nerfed Hunters. They are the enemy. :-)

However, I am wondering about all this downtime you folks are talking about. I played straight from day one very intensely (at least 8 hours per day or more) for about 2 months to get my hunter to level 60, then quit because the content stopped at that point. I am on Silvermoon server.

Are you guys dealing with server-specific stuff maybe? Because man, our server has been smooth sailing for a long time. We had a few days of weird auction house problems, then they fixed it and I can only remember two times I couldn&#039;t get online.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m fairly new to WOW and I&#039;ve lately been reading your blog and others to get background info, strategies etc.  It strikes me that many MMORG veterans spend an inordinate amount of time whining about how terrible everything is and how Blizzard is somehow beholden to your every gripe or concern.  My experience with this and other Blizzard products has been excellent and as such I will continue shell out my money. Sure, I&#039;ve had occasional lag problems, but never once had to wait in queue.  The two major patches received,  I downloaded with no issues directly from WOW.  In one important sense you vets are right: Blizzard doesn&#039;t listen to you and probably never will.  They know their future market is fueled by neebies and they will continue to cater to their needs.  Blizzard ain&#039;t cheap (whatever that means when applied to a successful business), they&#039;re just smart. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[On the point about previous MMOs . . . 

Just because the infrastructure is half or a third as shitty as the previous MMOs to you, doesn&#039;t make it acceptable.

&quot;WoW doesn&#039;t hurt half as much as the other MMOGs did!&quot; . . . but why should it hurt at all?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I beg to differ.  Quality?  Ya.  Performance?  No way in hell, not with regular server crashes 4 months into live.

I can appreciate they&#039;ve spent more on development than anyone in history and they need to cover those expenses as quickly as they can, but goddamn, if people can&#039;t play when they want to play, why pay?

I can forgive all the other crap that is inevitable when trying to entertain 1.5 million people, but worsening lag and more frequent server crashes does not bode well, especially in comparison to EQ, DAoC, SWG launches.  (Ok, AO a notable exception there.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I call bullshit on this post. WoW has set a new bar for MMOG quality and performance, yet you talk like it&#039;s the worst release ever. They also have spent more money on WoW than any MMOG to date.

You need to seriously check yourself, and then think back to UO, EQ, AO, etc. if you experienced any of that. I was there for all of them and WoW is sheer bliss compared to that.

(Foton:  Spam Karma ate Adam&#039;s comment, no idea why.  Anyhoo, restored the comment.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One of the things I have read is that this patch was announced on the 7th of March on the test servers, tested for 2 weeks there, and then installed on all of the player servers. 2 weeks of testing, in my book, does not seem to be enough time to iron out all of the bugs.

I fully expect to find problems in Dire Maul and with the new dragons. Hopefully some of the old problems they fixed with this patch stay fixed and do not create new problems.

Been downloading the patch since yesterday. Poor 56k modem never knew what hit it. Probably take me 16 hours to download it!

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s terrible because the essential choice we are presented with is give up WoW or deal with Blizzards sheer incompetence.  They do not seem to have their priorites in order at all, and I have stopped recommending the game to others as a result.  The server I am on has crashed at least once a night for the last few days before the patch. They have had months now to fix the issues, and have not managed to make much headway.  Having said that, once I got past the awful hurdles of my primary server being down for eight hours and the patch taking it&#039;s sweet time to dl, my in game experience playing last night was much better than it had been before this patch.]]></description>
