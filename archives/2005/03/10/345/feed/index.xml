					<description><![CDATA[actually these problems are not easily predictable.
Blizzard made a rather long beta test, and a long open beta too, everything was going fine then, they didn&#039;t expect to need 80 servers.

You might say they should have been prepared, i agree they maybe should, but i also understand why they were not, because a success like this could not have been predicted by anyone....


Ps: being a WoW Subscriber AND an EQ2 subscriber i must note that EQ2 got the same (if not bigger) problems with zones crashing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One of the damned from the servers of the damned signing in.

Stealing Lineage&#039;s IT people is a great idea - anything to alleviate this bullshit would be welcome.

					<description><![CDATA[And yet &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-general&amp;t=1901864&amp;p=1&amp;tmp=1#post1901864&quot;&gt;another update&lt;/a&gt;.

Seems to be an appropriate restitution to the cursed players:  5-day time extension (per the usual guidelines .. heh, usual downtime guidelines.  sad.) and full rested experience.  They&#039;d probably rather be able to play, as I would, but if ya can&#039;t, this seems good.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think it&#039;s their IT people.  SOE at it&#039;s peak had 460k Subscribers.  WoW has almost 1.5M subscribers.  It is like triple SoE user base.  I think they need more servers in the pool of servers that makes up a realm.  They are probably tweaking the NLB settings.

They may not have done much more then built a better EQ but they are in uncharted waters as far as # of subscribers goes.  What they need to do is steal some of the people who engineered Lineage&#039;s infrastructure.  They have the money now to pour into new hardware so maybe we will see an end to these issues in the near future.

My realm has been fairly blessed.  I have had it go down a couple of times but certainly no where near daily. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So I saw this interview:
http://www.cgonline.com/content/view/467/2/

My favorite quote:
Shane Dabiri: We continue to place more copies of World of Warcraft into the market at a steady pace. It might not be as fast as some gamers would like, but we are trying our best to meet the demand. **We&#039;re quite happy with the level of service we have currently,** and so you have seen an increase in the number of units for sale across the country. As recently as last month, 70,000 new copies were put on store shelves in North America.

Well, apparently, the constant crashing of multiple servers brings them satisfaction and maybe an overall sense of well-being.]]></description>
