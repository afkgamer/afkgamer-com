					<description><![CDATA[Man, that story was much cooler when I thought it was real (up until about the part where he was pushing her down the stairs).  Once you realize it&#039;s fake, it is pretty funny about this chick running uterus-first into a counter.  But a piano fell on my head once I discovered this was made up.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;She just sat there smiling, then made a strange face -- and then she exploded and a piano fell on her head.&quot;

I believe he is metaphorically describing the abrupt change from how she was happy that he hit her to suddenly realizing that she is in intense pain. Exploded maybe means that she cried out in pain, &quot;Piano on the head&quot; maybe how it would look if something like that were suddenly to happen. A complete and swift change from happy to agony. Regardless, yeah, it&#039;s pretty obvious it&#039;s a made up story. But, it&#039;ll probably become an urban legend.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is proof that I&#039;ve failed to truly adapt to our harsh society even after 7 years of online gaming.  Even assuming from the beginning that the story was completely unhindered by factual content, it made me sick to my stomach.

It&#039;s either that or the clavicord that just fell on me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The things people do for fun while waiting for a server to come up.  The poster of the story had this to say:
&quot; I was the OP of the thread. Got a 5 hour ban but it was totally worth it.

The sad/cool thing (depending on your opinion of the story) is that I came up with it about a year and 1/2 ago on LUE, so I was actually copying from myself.

Anyways thanks to anyone that found it funny, and to anyone that found it appauling (ihavenolife), thanks for giving me a good laugh.&quot;]]></description>
