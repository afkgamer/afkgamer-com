					<description><![CDATA[0 for two, I&#039;m afraid.

Nobody could really find anything wrong with the dice roll post unless they just want to find faults in Blizzard and see them EVERYWHERE.

That isn&#039;t a blizzard thread, it&#039;s a white post about blizzard threads (Because the goddamn forumers ignore blue posts one minute and then complain they don&#039;t get answers the next)

I heartily agree with your last lines - Blizzard has now lowered the bar.
