					<description><![CDATA[Woot!  Acknowledgement from the peanut gallery!  Of course I&#039;ve made mistakes, silly lad, but I like to think I&#039;ve learned from my mistakes and the mistakes of others who&#039;ve tread the same path.  

Such a silly fanboy argument, &quot;Well, YOU&#039;RE NOT PERFECT and YOU&#039;VE NEVER MADE a game, so how DARE you criticize?&quot; 

Listen to Foton - the ham-handedness of these actions, with no means to counter them effectively, would suck coming from any company.  

You&#039;ll note that in this topic here:  https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/archives/2005/03/03/something-rotten-in-azeroth/#comments  -that I agreed with you on your last point.  ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think the large problem was locking the accounts while they were investigating.  Even 5 minutes of thought would have told them there could be many benign reasons that a character (and a low-level one at that) would accumulate large amounts of game currency.

Locking first, asking questions later puts the onus on the player to seek restoration of his account (for which HE IS PAYING) -- the appeals process is virtually nonexistent.

Of course we all make mistakes, but repeated gross errors in judgement is quite another thing.  Not every cheater can be caught with algorithms and data traps.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Blizzard made a mistake.  They admitted it and corrected it.  What&#039;s the problem?  I guess by that attitudes Abalieno, Bloo and the coward hiding behind Anon that they have never made a mistake.  Grats lads on being perfect...NOT!

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;!-- spamk    : Comment text: &#039;This is sadly hilarious.  One of the other online game blogs mentioned &quot;mudflation&quot; and I believe that it&#039;s inevitable.  Blizzard is incredibly noobish and downright stupid about how they&#039;re handling issues in-game.  I agree with Abalieno - this drama-sleight-of-hand bullshit is distracting the masses from the real lack of content and customer service that they&#039;re subjecting themselves too.

					<description><![CDATA[There was a nasty autohouse exploit exposed recently that at least one person was abusing to amass large amounts of gold. And that&#039;s just one that&#039;s been talked about, there may be other shady methods being used. So frankly, I don&#039;t have a problem with Blizzard actions - given that they did follow up with the investigation promptly.

Never go on an adventure without a hat!

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Wreak for the update on the first link.  The 2nd link was resolved thusly:

I wanted to clear things up a little. This account was specificly locked due to both excessive gold being stored on the account, and questionable behavior associated with the gold. Protecting the game economy is very important to us.

I know they&#039;ll never share what constitutes questionable behavior ... but wording the response so as to raise IGE/ebay suspicions is a nice touch.]]></description>
