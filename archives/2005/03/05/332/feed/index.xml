					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d be willing to contribute. Heck, I&#039;d love to see this idea posted very soon.

Next weekend to be exact. (March 18th)

Anyway, keep us updated. I&#039;ll give this a trackback (assuming I&#039;ve learned to use them correctly).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Stephen: I think insiders could offer a unique perspective that would be valuable.  Even the boastful kind of industry dudes.  (I kid!  I kid!)

In the next two days, I&#039;ll send an email to a few of the commenters here that expressed an interest in helping admin/organize this cluster ... blog, soliciting opinions and suggestions.

If you want to follow this project and have some suggestions, blah blah, shoot me an email: Foton(at)afkgamer.com.  I&#039;m at the &quot;twisting arms&quot; stage, so anyone else that wants to climb aboard, send an email.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d really like to be in, but I&#039;m an MMO industry insider, and I&#039;m not sure how you&#039;d feel about that. (Not boasting, it&#039;s just the truth.)

I read this blog religiously though, and have blogged on and off for about four - shit, five years - just never about gaming. Been thinking about it recently just because I&#039;m playing so many games.
