					<description><![CDATA[Well, I wouldn&#039;t claim farmer in WoW are more balanced to one faction or the other other.  That&#039;s just nonsense.  I&#039;ve seen both.  In fact, a group of guildies went up to Azshara a few weekends ago to mess with the farmers.

This is what we saw.  I caught one rogue and messed him up.  Then, there was a mage and a druid (I think).  When I rode over a hill to meet the guildies and then right back, they had were logging.  The guildies said they were doing that all night.  They would log out of those characters and log into another set that were somewhere else far away from us so we&#039;d ride around to find that other set.

Also what I&#039;ve seen is farmers who would in groups of opposite faction.  You can spot those because let&#039;s be serious, when is the last time you saw two groups of opposing factions in the same area and they didn&#039;t try to kill each other.  Correct!  Never (I&#039;m on a PVP Server).  These groups work to counter the effect that my guildies were bringing to them.  Basically, the Horde set will fight against us (alliance) while the Alliance farm.  And if a group of Horde were to pass by, the Alliance set attacks the Horde in the area.  This allows them to protect their precious farm areas by making sure they don&#039;t have to compete with same faction groups while allowing them the ability to fend of opposite faction groups while they still get farming done.

I think this fits well with Foton&#039;s 4 slaves to 1 machine idea. :-)

Also, people wonder how farming hurts the game besides the usual economy argument.  A few of our newer guildies, who are also new to MMO, were asking who had high fishing skill because they needed a certain fish for a potion.  I think I was the highest but I had quit fishing a long time ago.  Reason?  Because Blizzard gimped fishing.  Now, I don&#039;t agree about the way Blizzard did it, but the fact that they HAD to do ANYTHING with it was due to farmers running fishing bots.  Personally, I hope they fix fishing to make it worthwhile again some day.  Maybe implement an anti-bot code like FFXI did to help curb botting.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[on my server &quot;Lothar&quot; the chinese farmers are a REALY big problem. They&#039;ve pretty much blown the hell out of the market and value of gold. It&#039;s gotten REALY fukin bad. I think it&#039;s become that bad not only because of the chinese farmers, but because it seems the majority of them are ALL aliance characters and only selling to the Aliance market and not horde so they&#039;re inflating one faction while the other has an entirely different economy.]]></description>
