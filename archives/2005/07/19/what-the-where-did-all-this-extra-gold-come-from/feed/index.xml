					<description><![CDATA[Meh.  The temptation is always there, but so is the knowledge that the economy I&#039;d be screwing up (okay, screwing up more) is the one I have to deal with if I keep playing.

And honestly, as much as I&#039;ve been laughed at for saying it in other situations, cheating just takes the fun out of the game.  When I start using cheat codes and hacks, it&#039;s a pretty good sign I won&#039;t be playing that game much longer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[considering i worked nearly 3 months to get my epic mount and still have not finished the temptation to &quot;do&quot; was rather high, but i have some years ago promised myself never to exploit anything knowingly (sp?) and so far i have done that.

It&#039;s funny though that absolutly everyone and their monkey knows about this today, i know blizzard stationed GMs at some instance entrances to watch this behaviour and i know of at least 15 people who go banned on my own server in the last 2 days for duping, so at least they are trying to react.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I say do. After all, all this inflation can only weaken the market for gold farmers. If China is going to manipulate their currency to screw over the U.S. economy, why not manipulate WoW currency to screw over THEIR economy, BWAHAHAHA!!!!!

					<description><![CDATA[I know your adage &quot;exploit early and often&quot; was partially in jest, but duping (above all other exploits) affects every one of us.

If the question was a simple as &quot;is it right or is it wrong&quot;, we know the answer to that.  It&#039;s not that simple, however, and those who don&#039;t exploit pay a huge price, for many months to come.]]></description>
