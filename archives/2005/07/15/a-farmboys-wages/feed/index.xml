					<description><![CDATA[We had the rogue weird-guy/farmer last night (though his name didn&#039;t fit in your naming convetions, Foton). Constantly ran ahead, saying &quot;kill now&quot; etc., while we were still drinking or summoning or whatever. Made the hunter dude who was on his first character pay for enchants. (Meanwhile I&#039;m giving away healthstones and the alchemist is pouring potions down our throats faster than you can say jello shot.) Behaved on the first two chests, then ninjaed the third, grabbed the loot he clearly knew was going to be in it, then suddenly  &quot;I have to log&quot; and he&#039;s hearthstoned back to IF before we know it, not even bothering to leave the group so we have to all ditch and reform. (We weren&#039;t in an instance, so that was fine.)

This kind of thing popping up more often does seem to be a function of the community maturing (in the sense of getting larger and broader, not in the sense of becoming more adult and responsible). The problem is there&#039;s no way to take your revenge. Perhaps one day there will be a blacklist service to subscribe to or something, an eBay like reputation system built by some ambitious modder. Still, alts might make that kind of useless. Interesting to think about.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We had this guy on our server named Wowvsmtg.  Maybe he was trying to trick people by overloading on consonants instead of vowels, I&#039;m not sure.  He ended up in a scholo raid with me one day a few months ago, didn&#039;t speak the entire time, had all green gear, and tanked with a dagger (I was the other tank).  I was so positive this guy was a farmer that I was on edge the whole time, waiting for the inevitable cadaverous gloves ninja or something, but to my suprise the raid passed uneventfully.  I made some inquiries and have had several people swear up and down that he&#039;s not a farmer, just a really wierd guy with questionable taste in weaponry.  Go figure.]]></description>
