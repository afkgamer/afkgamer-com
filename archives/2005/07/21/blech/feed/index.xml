					<description><![CDATA[What galls me about this whole thing is that everyone&#039;s making a huge deal out of something that requires an UNAUTHORIZED download to even access (and then, only on the PC version), and is (truth be told) kind of pixellated and cheesy anyway, but no one seems to take any notice of the sex mini-game in &quot;God of War&quot;! Granted, you can&#039;t see what&#039;s going on during the game, but the cutscene leading into the game is very realistically rendered, and detailed. Of course, &quot;God of War&quot; isn&#039;t published by that evil corrupter of unsupervised youth, Rockstar Games.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Justme has a good point - but at the same time I know that a lot of folks have an issue with where we draw the line about freedom of expression.

It&#039;s one thing to watch a violent movie and walk away from the experience.  A game is different (to me anyway) - where I&#039;m controlling the action and actually taking the baseball bat to some random hookers head.  Or getting my baseball bat some head from a random hooker (mileage varies either way.)  

The fun of the game is the choices you make and the freedom from real consequences that we enjoy.  What scares the morality police is that we&#039;re able to make those decisions and seemingly walk away from the experience unscathed.

While I&#039;m no fan of censorship - I&#039;m also no fan of companies that go out of their way to make something as violent and degrading as possible simply because they can.  It impacts the perception of *all* gamers and all games.

Parents *should* parent.  My boys won&#039;t touch a game like this for a while.  At the same time - the corporate fucksticks that do stuff like this need to stop giving the whole industry a vigorous dick in the eye just to find a way to hawk a few more games.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The sad thing about this whole fiasco is it&#039;s just going to scare companies into making games that are pointed towards adults.  We shouldn&#039;t be applauding this as gamers; If Hilary and the morality police have their way, we&#039;ll all be playing Kirby games the rest of our lives.  Studies show that the majority of people who buy and play games are over 18.  If a parent doesn&#039;t supervise his child correctly and notice what they are doing when they are in front of the boob tube for hours on end, I can&#039;t blame any manufacturer.  And if a parent was to buy a game for their child, the &quot;MA&quot; rating should be more than enough.  Besides the points that the box tells you about the violence, sex, and drugs... Oh sure, little Billy should have THAT game.  My son will not play ANY game that has grand theft auto in the title until he is at LEAST 15. I, on the other hand, enjoy it.

Don&#039;t look at it this way because you hate the game, it&#039;s actually just another pull at freedom of expression when it comes to video games.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for making my day:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hot Coffee, that sex minigame/mod inside Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Although Rockstar, and parent Take2 Interactive, getting caught with their metaphoric pants down was priceless, the game was, is and always will be (I&#039;m being kind here) borderline-racist garbage.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Best nutshell review of that game that I&#039;ve seen pretty much anywhere.]]></description>
