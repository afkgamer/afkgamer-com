					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with Roman - wouldn&#039;t it be nice if they had AH terminals in the larger towns that reflected the nearest auction house?  FFXI could manage it, and there isn&#039;t a more player-unfriendly game out there than FFXI.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s bullshit. It&#039;s simply because of the auction house. If all mobs would have been in a single place it would have been much laggier than Ironforge. Adding some additional auction houses that work on the same network would greatly ease the lag.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Also American: Doesn&#039;t it strike you that the laggiest place in Azeroth--Ironforge--is also the most commercial? Kind of an interesting statement about the people in WoW: the thing they&#039;re (we&#039;re) most interested in is making money. All those cool quests and colorful mobs just can&#039;t keep &#039;em away from the auction house.]]></description>
