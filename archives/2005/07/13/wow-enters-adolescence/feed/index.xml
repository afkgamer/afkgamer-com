					<description><![CDATA[I am in a guild.  Important raids, we don&#039;t allow outsiders for the very reasons you cite.  There are other situations and instances where outsiders are allowed.

I believe the large majority of WoW players regularly group with non-guildies.  Some times (most times?) these are satisfactory grouping experiences.

What about alts?  Raid guilds aren&#039;t going to carry an alt, they don&#039;t even want to see the alt, until it&#039;s viable in the endgame.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What the heck are you doing in pickup groups and raids? Join a guild that isn&#039;t full of morons and all of these problems go away. I can&#039;t see why you&#039;d whine about grouping with morons if you choose to group with morons instead of taking the standard moron-avoidance route: join a guild.

Yes, there are guild that raid (and actually kill bosses) and aren&#039;t full of morons.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When I played a priest I got away with the premadonna whoring of the loots. 

&lt;em&gt;&quot;If that specific shiney drops it&#039;s mine or I don&#039;t roll with your group.&quot;&lt;/em&gt; 

I&#039;ve been burned and unlucky too many times on shitty drop rates with pugs in the past, but I didn&#039;t and still don&#039;t have a regular crew of foozles in WoW, making my loot whoring tough. And yes, it&#039;s an ass move, but when you don&#039;t have a regular crew all that matters is the loot and looting rules like random and the vague interpretation of nbg are your worst enemy. haha.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[on my server there is currently a large discussion of purple should be affected by NBG rules or not.

The way i see it random purple items (like krol blade) should be rolled among the whole group, but if rogue XY wants it he can buy it for a sensible price from the winner.

I ran ~30 raids with that rule and the one time we had a purple drop it actually worked (with a rogue buying the krol for 250g from the mage who won)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yah i hate that bullcrap people pull where some BoE blue or purple will drop and out of NO WHERE the ARMS WARIOR will claim he NEEEEDS that sheild that just dropped because one day he &quot;might&quot; go protection. SCREW THAT! That shit will get you banned from raids I do or am in quicker then you can say &quot;Imadouche&quot;. 

On another note. I dont think TWICE about leaving a raid group in the begining of a run if it starts to show that people are fukin incompetent dick holes that dont know what they&#039;re doing. Like rogues bitching the priest isn&#039;t giving them full heals while the warrior is neck deep in boss mob shit. 

Not liking the fact that the mobs are beating the ever living CRAP out of you because you stole agro from the Tank(s)? TO FRIKEN BAD USE FAINT OR SOME OTHER AGRO TRICK YOU DOUCHEBAG!

I also cant stand it when another paladin in my raid group is being a dumbass and giving blessing of wisdom to the mages INSTEAD of the salvation he should be doing to ALLLLLLLLLL his party except the Tank.

There i&#039;m done venting.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, had that crap happen on an UBRS raid this past weekend.  We got 4/5 of the way to the ending and a purple dropped.  It was BOE and there was a scuffle over who got the 1H mace with healing bonus.  The priest obviously would have more *need* than someone who ended up getting it (a mage I think).

Anyways, a fight errupted over it and one of the freaking bastard Warriors decided that the best way to resolve the issue would be to charge into the next room, aggro EVERYTHING, and have everyone die.  Thank god I had a SS on the priest.  Of course, we kicked the warrior and his helper and spent the next 30 mins trying to reform the group.]]></description>
