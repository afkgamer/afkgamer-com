					<description><![CDATA[Rather unsurprisingly, it turns out that once MTV came calling, &lt;a href=&quot;http://us.gizmodo.com/gadgets/gaming/the-truth-behind-girls-against-video-games-139612.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the attention whores came  out of the woodwork&lt;/a&gt;.  It seems that now that MTV has left town, the Girlfriends Against Videogames group&#039;s traffic evaporated.

It&#039;s times like this I&#039;m glad I married a woman that can kick my ass at Tiger Woods golf.  :)]]></description>
