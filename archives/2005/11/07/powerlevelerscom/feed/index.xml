					<description><![CDATA[Do not trust this website. I paid for level 1-80, full epic flyer, epic craftables, and more. The gold in total was around 12000. This was promised within 13 days.

After 21 days, they achieved level 61. Then, my account was banned for 24 hours. I tried to get my money back, but they would not - and they would not give me any of the gold they promised. In short, they ripped me off badly.

I currently am in the process of filing a lawsuit. 

DONT USE THIS WEBSITE.]]></description>
