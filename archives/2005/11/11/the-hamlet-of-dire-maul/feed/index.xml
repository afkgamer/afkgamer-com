					<description><![CDATA[It can still be farmed. I invited a farmer into my group and entered the instance with him to see what he was doing (curiosity) anyway we entered about the same time when i got in tho he was gone. I waited and watched his buffs / hp mana (he had full dm tribute buffs) and about 20 minutes later he got gordock king buff. He was the only 1 in the party and didnt talk to me or anything. He was solo farming king for sure.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;You guys know -- you would have been better off not complaining, as more gold farmers did this there would be more in the AH forcing the prices down, making it so everyone could afford them, not just the people that have got lucky and found a epic.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
well think about it, the lower the price goes. the less someone who got it legitly could make, about 3 days after 1.9 patch was released i bought my ace of warlords for 150g, now they are 19g.... thyat is not good for the economy, plus &quot;normal&quot; playes still wouldn&#039;t get 2000g that easily UNLESS they found an epic, so either way you got screwed.]]></description>

Though the &quot;new&quot; way to make money seems to be farming DM with your guild, and the prices are starting to go down.
Though it was a good read and very well put togeather =)]]></description>
