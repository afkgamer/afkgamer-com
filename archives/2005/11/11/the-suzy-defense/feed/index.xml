					<description><![CDATA[Aggrome -- don&#039;t know about children destroying relationships either, but they can be hell on a guild.  (e.g. FFS, PLEASE don&#039;t tell us about your day at school.)

Hyd -- I thought that was odd too.  I&#039;d think the protocol is &quot;change the locks&quot;.  I&#039;d expect no less myself.

Conn -- In the interest of science, you could try to get a real life hookup with each and report back to us.  Do it for science, man!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We have 4 girls in our guild.  The married plays with her husband nicest people in the world girl, the middle aged e-flirt, the late 20s/early 30s has a fiance who doesn&#039;t play, and the early 20s/late teen quiet type. Makes me wonder which one of them has the Suzy thing going on.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I thought the usual protocol in these cases, rather than wifey bolting and leaving dumbass with the kids, was to throw the husband out of the house.  Afterwards, she then promptly relieves him of half of all his stuff.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Heh, I read that earlier today and was wondering what the heck Suzy did wrong.  I also thought this line was a bit much, &quot;Not to mention the countless others in the game who listened to the things I said, and showed utmost respect for me.&quot;  Countless? All in all a good read though.

But forget blaming Suzy, one comment on Joystiq starts blaming &lt;em&gt;children&lt;/em&gt;. &quot;Marriage will note (sic) destroy your relationship with your wife... children will.&quot;]]></description>
