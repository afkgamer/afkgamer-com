					<description><![CDATA[Why is it the priests are always the oldest ones in the guild?  (60 Troll priest, feathermoon, here, and at 30+ - won&#039;t tell you how much +, but I&#039;m the oldest in my guild).  Ditto from my EQ days - and I was the oldest then, too.  Sad, I know.

But just to add to the entertainment value - my father in law plays too, and he HAS made the kind of comments you&#039;re talking about.  Nothing, nothing on earth beats watching an argument between your kid and your father-in-law go from group, to guild, to general and then to yell.  Awesome.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha.  Ya, I leave general off too most of the time.

I&#039;ve noticed the chatters have started to creep into the trade channel now.  Probably caught on that no one was left in general anymore to hear every last detail about &quot;how their day went&quot;.]]></description>
