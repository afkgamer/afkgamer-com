					<description><![CDATA[&lt;strong&gt;Roll for initiative&lt;/strong&gt;

Foton at AFK Gamer informs us about World D&#038;D Game Day which apparently is this weekend. We were planning on a bit of construction time this week but I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll try and find time to throw the dice around in honor.

					<description><![CDATA[This crap kills me (i.e. chick.com).  Growing up in the Deep South in the 80&#039;s, I remember when my parents quizzed me on if my friends or I play D&#038;D.

Sure, I played a bit - AT BOY SCOUT CAMP.  But did that matter?  Nope.

I love the irony, tho.  We were encouraged to go outside and play army and dress up in fatigues and run around with guns, instead of playing D&#038;D.

This was all before Columbine, of course.  ;-)]]></description>
