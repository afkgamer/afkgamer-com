					<description><![CDATA[The hops for the Thunderbrew quest in WestFall drop so rarely now my group had to share theirs with me or we would have been killing the Harvest Reapers for a f---ing long time.

					<description><![CDATA[Wait, are you trying to say that your technique is somehow &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;?  I don&#039;t understand.  That seems perfectly reasonable to me!  :)  Seriously, that&#039;s how I quest all the time.  I feel like going to thottbot before I&#039;ve even read the quest description might be taking it too far, but other than that...  If I follow the directions and go to the spot they say and I&#039;m still confused, then come one, thottbot is there to help!

And cooking recipes are rarely as easy as they should be, since the darn animals seem to decide that they&#039;re keeping their meat to themselves whenever it becomes a quest to get an otherwise frequent drop.  Darn smart food.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Weird.  Mine was gone when I stopped off in Gadget.  I hadn&#039;t used it in 4-freaking-ever, but griff master told me to saddle up.  Think she called me a noob too, but I don&#039;t speak dirf.

EDIT:  ok, my alt has the griff point still, so either I was drunk on the main without realizing it, or there was something goofy with that.  AFK Gamer regrets any implied complaints regarding the Shithold griff point.  No, really.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One of the great things about adding new non-instanced high level content is that it brings some world PVP back into game somewhere other than BRM.  I&#039;ve just been flying out to Cenarion Hold to pick up some faction and catch beef with alliance outside the town.  Fun stuff.]]></description>
