					<description><![CDATA[I hate to tell you this but Guild Wars is all about &quot;noobs&quot;.

It was designed to be about noobs. The developers constantly do things to make the game and the economy more and more accessible to the noobiest of players, and if that completely screws veteran players over, they don&#039;t care.

Guild Wars was designed to be incredibly simple. It is more of an introduction to MMORPG than it is an MMORPG.

The PvE is incredibly easy with a full team, even in the newly introduced &quot;Hard Mode&quot;. The PvP is a joke, having less to do with the skill of the individual players, or the teams skill, and more to do with wether or not you are prepapred for the build the other team is running. All in all it boils down to more grinding than anything else.

It is also important to not that Guild Wars has no type of developer presence in game. People run around scamming and touting themselves as the second coming while putting everyone else down. You can report them, but it does no good as the dev&#039;s really couldn&#039;t care less once you have bought the game.

Guild Wars charges no monthly fee, so even the utter lack of depth does not prevent it from having a huge player-base.

It is a crap game, and it is run in a crap way, but it is also worth the purchase price......

As long as you can deal with the 1 million 1 noobies.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, if you&#039;re a healer class and haven&#039;t earned a reputation as a complete incompetent, you&#039;ll get picked up really quickly.

The incompetents just have to wait a little longer, sadly :/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[No, it&#039;s not crap.  Just play with good people or people you know.  Good teamwork is a must if you want to get through well.  Just wait till Riverside.

The only other gripe I have with GW is the insatiable need for a healer.  You&#039;re always waiting to do mission while waiting for a healer.  If you want to get through the game fast, be a monk.

Is this the same for WoW?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awe man, don&#039;t tell me that GW is crap at the end.  Let me bask in the newness (to me at least).  It&#039;s my vacation from being bored with WoW content.

My only hope is that more games will be like GW with no monthly fee.  Then I can play 4-5 at a time so that it takes 4-5 times longer to reach the game climax.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Allow me to add some clarity. VC is short for Van Cleef who is the boss you kill in Deadmines (the first alliance instance). SW stands for StormWind, you know the big castley place near the green foresty place. =/&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ahhh...that&#039;s why.  I&#039;m a horde guy (at least right now).  I haven&#039;t experienced any of the Alliance content yet.]]></description>
