					<description><![CDATA[UO2.  Nice graphics, same camera, UO:Rish gameplay, new map, new monsters.  

That&#039;s innovation.

All the games now are pointed at EQ.  Why not base one off the most fun instead of the most successful?  

I think the Nintendo DS has potential for MMO&#039;s.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For having played WoW &#039;till its out i bloody aggree with everything you said. 

However, i play on a french server and trust me, you have nothing to envy about use and our european server. I mean they are all full of fucking pricks who only care about getting the fucking Ub3R 1337 items my ass and won&#039;t give a shit about anybody else if they ninja. 

It&#039;s like beeing in Leeroy&#039;s movie all the time and it really sucks. You can still try hard to get those fuckers banned, GM don&#039;t give a fuck neither : )

Anyway good look to you buddy !]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well... I played WoW for four months, got my paladin into the mid-50&#039;s (along with a number of 10-20 alts...) and checked out what I had to look forward to in the end-game.

I let my subscribtion lapse and went back to Runescape.

Ok... the games has primitive graphics (runs in a web browser under Java, for god&#039;s sake...) but the game play is fun... almost everything is soloable, in fact there aren&#039;t really groups.  You can level every skill/class in one character, and the max level takes a looooong time and lots of effort to reach... a couple years, and I haven&#039;t maxed anything, not even close.

Never go on an adventure without a hat!

					<description><![CDATA[Well, what&#039;s the alternative then?  EQ2?  Dragon empi^H^H^H^H I mean RF Online?  D&#038;D Online?  Auto Assault?  We&#039;re back to that age-old (old man!  old as dirt!) discussion of innovation and doing something new in MMOGs, because it&#039;s just the same thing over and over again.

With that said - what exactly do we want?  What new and innovating feature do we want to see in future games?  Don&#039;t forget that &quot;people fear change&quot;, so someone has to take that first step, take a chance, and do something different and new.

I&#039;ll just leave it at that, before I start sounding like Hrose. ;P]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Umm.  I&#039;d agree with you except ... it&#039;s same old, same old.  We have a running argument in the Guild between the Macro people and the non-Macro people, they call it the Raid by Touch people.

Either way, both groups can agree on this much ... something is fucked in Azeroth.  Whether you have a macro running it or a human, it&#039;s still the same flash heal.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You guys are silly.

You complain that the raiding is boring because you just hit your macro keys and read a book.

Get rid of the macro keys and the scripts!

Not so boring now when you have to figure out who is cursed, who to heal, which heal to use, what spell to cast. You made the game boring, not Blizzard. Duh!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Raiding as a Warlock is, if anything, even LESS stimulating than being a healer.  Target off the main assist, then hit the Shadowbolt key until the mob is dead.

Let&#039;s face it, 40 person raids are remarkably dull.  Maybe Zul&#039;Gurub will have room for individual skill or effort to have effect.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Raiding as a Priest for me is still pretty mindless.
