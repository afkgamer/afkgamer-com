					<description><![CDATA[I have screenshots that make this look intelligent. A re-enactment of one follows:

level53mage: Can someone tell me what vendors have high level alchemy recipes?
helpfulsoul: Uh...what&#039;s your alchemy at now?
level53mage: 300

Don&#039;t even ask about the SS that are green. Ugh.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[No slack for a newbie. 

Very bad karma ... 

Some day you will get a flat tire. You will be changing that tire. A Mack truck will drive by and start using you as a new hood ornament. 

As you are impaled on the hood of the Mack truck you will be wondering what in the world you did to deserve this. 

Now you know.]]></description>
