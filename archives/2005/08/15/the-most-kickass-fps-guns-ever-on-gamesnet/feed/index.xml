					<description><![CDATA[Half-Life 2 Gravity Gun 4TW!

That one&#039;s my favorite since no other weapon is as unique and allows you to be so creative in unleashing the carnage.  Wanna blow stuff up? No problem, grab a flammable container and chunk it.  Wanna eviscerate stuff?  No problem, just pick up those conveniently places buzz-saw blades and let the heads roll.  It also happens to be the only weapon that allows you to literally use the kitchen sink as a weapon.

The one thing missing was the upgraded version of the gravity gun that you get at the end.  Then you can suck up live targets and hurl them at other live targets killing both at once.  AWESOME!  I played the last chapter in HL2 over and over just for the fun of hurling Combine soldier into plasma sinks, or off ledges, or into other soldiers.]]></description>
