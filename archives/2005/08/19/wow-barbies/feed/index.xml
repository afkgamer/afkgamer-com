					<description><![CDATA[I can report that whatever bullshit they thought they were fixing with the midweek patch to the hardcore servers and the Friday patch to others ... Blizzard was sold a bill of goods.

Engage the boss, raid-wide lagariffic, mass discos.  Release, run back, repeat.  I, personally, have given Blizzard $200, and change, to date.  I&#039;ve seen minor improvements on hardware performance, sure.  I haven&#039;t seen $200 worth of improvements on that.  

And really, that&#039;s the important thing.  Anyone can take subscriptions.  *writes wildly in the air*  It&#039;s the hardware performance that&#039;s the minimal expectation.

EDIT:  I&#039;m sure it&#039;s just me, but I&#039;m hoping for another staged warrior protest on these nerfs.  Cuz I like anarchy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The lag and queues are so bad on my home server Blackrock that I finally gave up and created a new char on the new PvE server, Moonrunner.  I&#039;ve only ever seen one queue at like 8p on a Saturday night, and it was only like 50 people.

Even with the server full there&#039;s not much lag, and I can run through IF without hitting the Wall O&#039; Lag every time I come in view of the bank/AH area.

I suspect part of the problem on Blackrock is that because the server is so popular (it&#039;s the &quot;unofficial&quot; australian PVP server), the allowed number of players on the server was set higher by Blizzard so that the queues wouldn&#039;t be as bad.  This in turn leads to more stress on the hardware, which leads to more lag.  Yay!

I miss my characters on Blackrock a little, but I hadn&#039;t gotten any higher than 46.  In fact, my two main characters were stalled at 45 after February, thanks to getting a new job.  In the time between February and July, my guild morphed from a group of co-workers into a purple-obsessed late game raiding guild, and fuck anyone that can&#039;t help get the uber items.

Anyway, if you don&#039;t have 60s, I highly recommend moving to a low pop server.]]></description>
