					<description><![CDATA[Different strokes for different folks.  (zing!)

I think the SL creep factor for me is this:  this game doesn&#039;t just dance around the blurry line dividing reality and fantasy (as most games inevitably do), the game would have you believe there is no line.  

Traditional MMOGs, we have all that nonsense also, of course, but the larger populace has the good sense to mock it.  Ya, we mock.  Because it&#039;s so damn stupid.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What&#039;s so creepy about it? It&#039;s simple a structured development environment. It&#039;s the users that make it creepy, not the game itself. Give people the freedom to do what they want, and you&#039;ll suffer the consequences of people doing what they want. :)]]></description>
