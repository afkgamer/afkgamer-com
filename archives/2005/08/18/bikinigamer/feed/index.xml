					<description><![CDATA[While I respect your criticism, I totally don&#039;t believe anything my blog does is actually affecting the female gaming population. It&#039;s a blog, that&#039;s it. Get over it. Besides, there are actually a lot of female gamers out there. They just don&#039;t announce it to the public because of socially inept gaming nerds will freak out on the net and in online games. Anyways that&#039;s my two cents.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Why no contest to find Rallos Zek or Mithaniel Marr lookalikes?  They&#039;d probably have to sweeten the winnings considerably to get many apps ... I dunno, like a hooker and a case of beer as the prize ... but still, it&#039;s doable.

All this talk about marketing to women, encouraging women to game, blah blah, how bout we stop acting like this is a club for middle school wankers?  And when I say we, I mean them.

I&#039;m also available to provide diversity advice for homogeneous industries.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;how, we (the collective gaming industry-gamers-anything that has &#039;game&#039; as a suffix-we) are DRIVING women away.&quot;

  Hmm no.. that just doesn&#039;t seem right.

&quot;how, we game bloggers are DRIVING women away.&quot;

  Ah.. much better.

Hmm now I&#039;m off to look at an animated gif for half an hour.]]></description>
