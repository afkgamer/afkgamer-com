I&#8217;ve always been more of a destination kind of player, and, I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s just me or if that&#8217;s how past games trained me.

					<description><![CDATA[If you were serious about the binder, I think I saw some at Best Buy when I went to buy my copy of BC (normal version, they didn&#039;t have CE though I don&#039;t *think* I would have gotten it anyway....).

					<description><![CDATA[Let me just offer this tip from a guy who went from 0-310 Jewelcrafting in about a day. HUGE EMERALDS. Lots of them. 40 if you can get enough. And if you can&#039;t just get them, have about 100 extra thorium ore to prospect. The advantage of prospecting that thorium being that you not only get high level gems for skilling up, but you also may get lucky and get the Burning Crusade level gems you need for sockets. The only recipe(this isn&#039;t abusively expensive in mats) that is orange from 280-300 requires 2 huge emeralds.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Things went pretty smooth on my server, starting around 8:00 server time Outland started crashing pretty frequently, and this lasted until about 11:00.  On the whole though I&#039;m pretty impressed with how well it went.  I&#039;m really enjoying the new 5 mans and the feeling of being a noob again.  I only made it about 1/2 to 61 but have already replaced a few pieces of gear (nothing higher than T1 for me).]]></description>
