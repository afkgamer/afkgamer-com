					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;First, he wants you to pick up some animal shit. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hi I&#039;m Mike Rowe, and digging through poo for beans...it&#039;s a Dirty Job

It&#039;s funny though I was thinking the same thing when he sent me off to burn the village, I was like wow they have a nice religious zealot here. But we did it for sheer reward (ooooh XP gimme gimme), so I guess that makes all of us worse than he :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, the truly depressing thing is that was not the first, or second, time I&#039;d found myself heroically sifting through the droppings of some e-beast.

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;First, he wants you to pick up some animal shit. A LOT of animal shit.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reminds me of that oh-so-entertaining felhound doggywalk in Hellfire Peninsula.  That thing had rancid diarrhea-- Kill a boar, it munches it down.. two seconds later a nice, fresh, greenish-brown pile of happiness to dig through. I had to sift through about 15 piles of felhound dung to get that key. 

Y&#039;know I felt like an errand boy whilst doing quests before, but now Blizzard is turning me into a gimp.]]></description>
