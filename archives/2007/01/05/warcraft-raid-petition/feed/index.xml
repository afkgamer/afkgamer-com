					<description><![CDATA[Well without trying the new content it&#039;s hard to tell if i will miss it.

As a guild leader ... Never will I miss having to drag around 40 people, getting them to the right place at the right time and with the right gear to do what we need.  Having to orginised a guild of 70+ people just to maintain a 5 day raid schedule and have the raids full is a pain in the arse too but, it will be nice having a smaller closer group which means I can boot the freeloaders with no fear of not actually being able to get the numbers to raid naxxboss_006

But as a player, I think it might lose it&#039;s &#039;epic&#039; feel.  Only time will tell I suppose.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[...] Foton over at AFK Gamer pointed me in the direction of this post, which asks how many people out there are going to miss the 40-man raidstravaganzas that we won&#8217;t be seeing in the Burning Crusade? I sort of agree with Foton, who says, &#8216;I&#8217;m not missing them even now as we wait around for the expansion to go live.&#8217; Of course, not everyone agrees on these things &#8212; for various reasons. Sure, such a large group of players gave encounters a great epic feel, but less-so when it&#8217;s 20 people paying attention and carrying the weight of 20 people idly tapping keys while watching TV.

					<description><![CDATA[I love Karazhan, as a perfect example of a new raiding philosophy.
1) Only needs 10 people
2) Bosses are interesting and challenging instead of just massive resistence gear checks.
3) Because of the above 2, you can really find out who is dragging ass and introduce them to their new best friend, the curb.
4) Many of the bosses are optional, meaning you can speed through much of it in a decent amount of time and then come back through the convienent midway point later to finish up.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey I rode through on coattails and even I won&#039;t miss the 40 mans :P

Of course the new 25 mans will be the same big pain in the ass time sink as the current 40 mans, just with less people.

I really want someone to think (as posted here) about the fact that 3-5 hours through a raid for a majority of the week,is a BIG time sink that those with a life just can&#039;t do. Hell give me a quest line that would take me a long time to finish to get a comparable piece of gear.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The only people who will miss 40mans are those 15 fuckers who where pulled through them on the other 25&#039;s coattails.

I&#039;ll miss them about as much as I miss puberty.]]></description>
