					<description><![CDATA[Well from the start to present day definately the most nerfed class is still the rogue, I think they counted a concurrent patches that actually nerfed Rogues in some sort or another was about 12.

Weapon skill nerf for example.  The rogue review put the damn talent in to give rogues more damage against high level mobs then in the next patch they nerf it to shit just because they know shit all about their game.  Ever wondered why there is a stupid amount of rogues (apart from the whole stealth sneaky thing) is because at release they were just plain freaking stupidly overpowered, every man and his dog (or wife.. what ever) rolled a rogue because they were godly.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;b&gt;Staarkhand:&lt;/b&gt; Don&#039;t get me started on &quot;dps warriors&quot;. Especially dps warriors who insist they can still tank as well as prot-specced warriors, while dual-wielding, in zerker stance, while popping that fear-resist-take-lots-of-damage ability when no one&#039;s fearing them, just &#039;cause it gives them 5% extra damage.

Don&#039;t laugh. I&#039;ve seen it happen too many times now.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Warriors as the most gear dependent class has been nerfed consistantly as the overall power of items has been raised.  Their dps and survivability scales the fastest with better items then any other class so the developers keep nerfing their talents and abilities.

Warlocks have been the favorite target of nerf whining mostly because their fear in world pvp is the most effective crowd control spell.  It not only allows them to fully dot their targets but also usually gains the target mob aggro.

Hybrids are also the target of player nerf whining since they can spec to either become good at doing damage or healing.  As a result players tend to remember fights against different hybrids and group them together.  A player remembers fighting one shaman who earthshocks them for 1600 and another shaman who could fully heal himself in combat 5 times in a row.   Then they come to the conclusion that a shaman can do mage damage and heal like a priest and thus needs to be nerfed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Warlocks definatly get nerfed a ton, but usually in response to some overpowered element of our class.   I notice a nerf just about every significant patch, but I haven&#039;t complained about my class since they raised the debuff cap from 8 and fixed the Demo tree.

I think people cry nerf without considering the implications.   The most recent Warlock nerfs were so needed.  I was getting bored with slaughtering 5-6 well geared, equal level players while I was afk getting another beer.   Class balance is important for both sides to enjoy the game.  I want a challange and other people want a chance.

Classic MMO player&#039;s mentality:

&quot;I am Paper, Rock is fine, NERF Scisscors!&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Frequency of nerfs is a pretty useless metric, but inevitiably the one used the most.  No one seems to care to look at where these classes actually end up.

Priests:  The most consistently needed class in end game just got &#039;synergy&#039; in the form of &#039;here&#039;s infinite mana for your group&#039;.  Still melting fase, now with insta direct damage finishers.

Shaman:  Will not be happy until they have paladin&#039;s buffs, holy priest&#039;s healing, and rogue&#039;s dps.  I play horde and love my shaman, but I&#039;m done listening to their arguments about how refusing to acknowledge more than one aspect of their functionality makes them marginalized.  Blame this on on the DamageMeter era, which is the bane of the hybid class.

Warriors:  Were the best class in the game at 2 of the 3 diku holy trinity of group roles.  Now only the best at 1 out of three, although along with priests are the wholly ironic nominees for most effective hybrid class.   But still we&#039;re priviledged to hear constant whines from the 90% who styled themselves &#039;dps warriors&#039; with no interest in tanking.  Here&#039;s a hint, when chosing a class for the long haul make sure the way you want to play is in line with the developers&#039; vision for the class, and not merely emergent from some freak, previously not understood mechanic.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, Warriors have gotten the nerf stick quite often, and hard.

They&#039;re incredibly good in both PvE and PvP, still.

And now I&#039;m playing Shaman - people have cried about this class for ages, but now it&#039;s just as good as any other class, nothing spectacular.]]></description>
