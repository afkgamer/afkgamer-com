					<description><![CDATA[wow.  I&#039;m mostly stunned that the song &quot;Move Along&quot; could mean alot to someone.

My realm really needs a forum whipping boy.  We haven&#039;t had one for months.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sweet tapdancing christ, as soon as I saw the OP I knew it was gonna be ridiculous.  The OP is from my realm, and is ridiculed on almost a constant basis for his inane &quot;LOOK AT ME&quot; attention whore posts, and his terrible machina (sp?) movies which usually just include screenshots of the outside of Org and 24 point text.  

He is truly reviled.  He&#039;s the guy who is always making &quot;I quit!&quot; posts to which everyone replies &quot;No one cares, diaf&quot; only to show up three days later with a new movie.  I see he&#039;s really trying to kick it up a notch.

On top of that, judging by his voice acting in his movies and the way he acts, general concensus is that he can&#039;t be more than 13 years old, which would have made him like 6 when EQ came out.]]></description>
