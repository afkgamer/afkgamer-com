					<description><![CDATA[I just spent the entire weekend cooking, fishing and mining (levelling everything apart from my level... lol)  so that I can &#039;experience&#039; as much as possible of whatever comes after the penninsula (I don&#039;t even know...) I don&#039;t understand how everyone can race past all this new exciting content... I even know someone who&#039;s bored before they got to 70? But then, I&#039;ve never been a huge fan of competition, and I know plenty of people who would get the same satisfaction being ahead of their friends in every way possible...

Oooh and I left my guild again last night. Our ex-guild leader trained them well. To get as much personal gain from the guild as possible and screw everyone else.
Seriously. I can imagine the close-to-70&#039;s don&#039;t  wanna waste valuable levelling time to help the &#039;lazy nubs&#039;, but when there ARE enough appropriate levelled players to go instance, they take them when they&#039;re sposed to be making a group with us? What gives? Whilst whinging I also found mains being denied books in favour of the More Elite Alts... whatever. 

/whinge over (sorry about that. I feel better now.)

LF Guild!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Saylah,
I think it comes down to what part of the game you enjoy.  For me, the best part is the raiding, and especially progression style raiding before all the strats are known.  Being ahead of the pack so to speak.  I realize this is not for everyone, but it is how I choose to spend my time in the game.  Leveling is not the fun part for me.  Exploring every little nook and cranny...not so much.  For some reason being part of a &quot;team&quot; of people working to overcome an encounter does it for me.   So finding a guild that meshes with your idea of fun in the game is key.  I have that, and I hope you found one that suits your play style as well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My son is a day of effort away from level 70.  I think it&#039;s sick! I get that he loves raiding but in a couple of months it&#039;s going to feel like the same ole crap.  But that&#039;s coming from somone who left the guild when they tried for force raiding down my throat too much.

I&#039;m not into alts so the journey the first time is important to me.  Is raiding really that much fun to others that they&#039;re willing to race to it, knowing that there won&#039;t be any significant increases in new content again until the next xpac?  And that&#039;s a year off if we&#039;re lucky.  I think the guild churning is a result of some people pushing to 70, while others want to cruise to it but are afraid of losing their uber raid slots, so they&#039;re trying to keep one toe in the water.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jen, I&#039;m sorry, but that is just rediculous.  How on earth could your guild justify that?  And why would you comply with something so absurd.   I am shadow spec and can still heal groups just fine (I do have great healing gear).  The good thing about being a priest is that, even if you spec shadow you don&#039;t lose your heals.  A few are a bit slower, and yes, they are smaller, but it is still very much doable.   I did my time leveling holy and I wouldn&#039;t wish that on anyone.   Spec shadow and save your sanity before it is too late.  ;)  Having to rely on other people to level you isn&#039;t fair to you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;See, my guild is requiring us to have the same spec leveling as we would have at end game. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

/boggle.

What possible purpose could that serve?    I mean, whether I agree with it or not, I understand the reasons behind requiring someone to be a specific spec for raids, but what does it matter at all what spec you are when  not raiding?     

Even if you wanted to run to the talent guy and respec before and after every raid, how would that ever be any of their business?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t take this the wrong way, but maybe what this boils down to is that your guild is powerful but not fun.  When content is new you want to experience it in a fun way.  When you&#039;re maxed out and the content is meh, then you need a big raiding guild...which is productive but not fun.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was in one of those &quot;Union of two guilds for the betterment of both&quot; guilds and in the expansion we resplit our forces and have seen the return of many long gone but not forgotten friends. Its funny, they weren&#039;t interested in us while the loot was good, they were more interested in playing with people who weren&#039;t asshats. So when we banished the asshats (the other guild), lo and behold, they show. Quite a positive turn for us.

Also, we&#039;ve had alot of the &quot;I&#039;m tired of raiding my *insert class here* and I&#039;m switching to my alt&quot;. Its worked out alright as people can gear themselves incredibly quickly to &quot;better than main&quot; status, but we&#039;ve suddenly come up with quite a shortage of warriors. Go Go Bear Tank!]]></description>
