					<description><![CDATA[AFAIK another patch, only server side and thus not numbered has been released the 23th:

    * Khorium has been added back into the game.
    * Lady Palanseer in the Hall of Legends and Captain Dirgehammer in the Champion&#039;s Hall have returned and are now selling level 70 PvP rewards.
    * The drop rate of Draenei Prayer Beads for the quest &quot;Digging for Prayer Beads&quot; has been increased.
    * Fixed an issue where players were not getting rested experience in Shattrath on select realms.
    * Reduced the respawn time of the Zangarmarsh quest targets: Boglash, Lord Klaq, and Blacksting]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This patch means nothing in pvp, believe me :/ .. I still hate being 3 shotted by a hunter who is actually still on the move.  This is about endgame pve dmg, they are bringing hunters, mages and the godly shadowpriest back into line, which I might add is just under the Rogue dps :P

Oh and Cloak of shadows kicks ass.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;* The bonus coefficient for &#039;Shadow Word: Pain&#039; has been reduced by about 9%. This should result in about 5% less damage done by &#039;Shadow Word: Pain&#039;¬ù for the typical priest.&quot; 

But for your non-typical face melter, you still will be able to melt the hell out of anyones face, with an added 99% chance to aggravate them in the process as well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha, I&#039;ve seen it.  It&#039;s umm, interesting.   Very interesting.

Elbows - Ya, we&#039;re going to have a few arena teams going.  We spent some time pre-BC mapping out our formula for the Perfect Arena Team of Pwnage and, yes, it involves rogues.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Man, they need to nerf the Blood Elf female stealth animation. It&#039;s awesome.

Do yourself a favor and make one and get her to level 2 just to see it.

(HINT: It involves being shorter then a gnome when stealthed standing still)]]></description>
