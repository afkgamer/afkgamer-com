					<description><![CDATA[European Rolling restarts were flawless, the servers booted people at 12pm sharp (or 11 my time being in good ol&#039; blighty) I was playing 1min later by stealthing up and sprinting through the massive battle raging at the portal, I zoned in and it was  lag free untill I logged out.

I must say that it was quite suprising as the night started off badly with having to patch  the last 209 (ish) meg patch again, luckily I hadn&#039;t deleted it and it patched straight away, but there was a final 2mb patch that took about 30 mins on the crappy patcher before i was patched good to go.  The account upgrade page was available about 2 hours before hand so most people were activated and ready to go on the restart.

First impressions were good, good quest idea&#039;s (still some of the kill 5 of this 5 of that come back) and the rewards for someone who&#039;s not been raiding were fantastic (I found legs almost as good as Bloodfang without the on it on the 3rd quest I was doing).  We had a good explore around the first zone and found from 57-64 mobs along with our first instance.]]></description>
