					<description><![CDATA[I thought protection paladins were a myth, all my paladins seem to think that Ret is l33t and they can actually do damage on raids ...  Boy did they roll the wrong class.

The old EQ addage still rings true in my ears - &quot;Friends don&#039;t let friends roll paladins&quot;, or was that rangers... I can&#039;t remember.

As a guild leader I am becoming pretty adept at summing up a persons character from their application post.

Beware the priest who posts in bold pink with a bunny as a avatar on the forum.  I could list a plethora of other things to look for when looking at a application but im pretty sure most people know this shit already.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I always love reading your drama posts, at least partially to ward of the drama in my own guild.  I exist in a fairly low drama guild, but it has it&#039;s moments, like most recently the officer who tried to throw a revolution and nobody came, I think his new guild contains something like 5 ex-members. (and we are a Naxx raiding guild).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I totally know the priest in #1! Except I can&#039;t, because I don&#039;t play WoW, only ever played EQ. She was a cleric, he was a mage. It can&#039;t be the exact same person  - can it?]]></description>
