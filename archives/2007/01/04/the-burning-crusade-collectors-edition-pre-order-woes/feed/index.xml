					<description><![CDATA[I have also had mine pre-ordered from EBgames.com and have heard nothing. Hearing what you say puts me slightly at ease, though I have done some digging of my own on there site and found that they are also selling the collector&#039;s edition &#039;bundled&#039; at a higher price.

What I am wondering is if they are holding back on these pre-orders to see if they can get rid of overstocked inventory through these bundles with a high demand product. The reason I suspect this is that sometime around the 14th/15th they sent a payment request to my credit card that I used to pre-order, then on the 16th a stop payment was issued on that request.

No other .com company is selling any more collector&#039;s packs but EB-games seem to have additional in stock,  seems fishy to me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I ordered a Collector&#039;s Edition from Amazon, EBGames, and BestBuy.com just in case I got an e-mail stating that they had to cancel my order for whatever reason.  Well,  I didn&#039;t have any problems, and a week ago I cancelled all but the EBGames pre-order, seeing as how in the past pre-orders from them have typically arrived before the release dates.

And now, I&#039;m worried that I might have gotten slightly screwed.  I&#039;ve been checking out message boards and the like to see what&#039;s going on with other people&#039;s pre-orders, and it seems that if you placed your order with Amazon or Best Buy&#039;s site, that they shipped the games out on Wednesday and sent you a confirmation letter (Unless of course they cancelled your order).  EBGames, on the other hand, has been silent.  Sometime yesterday my order went from &quot;Shipping on 1/16&quot; to &quot;Processing&quot;, whatever that means, but apparently they haven&#039;t shipped it yet.

&lt;blockquote&gt;But, as I went digging through the EBGames site to find out who they ship through (because Monday is Martin Luther King Day, and the USPS isn&#039;t working then) I noticed that they have a brief write-up that says this:
Occasionally, you&#039;ll receive a pre-ordered product before we get tracking numbers and order statuses processed into our system. EBgames.com tries to get every game into your hands at the earliest possible date. To accomplish this, we sometimes use external resources that ship the product directly from the source, thereby eliminating any handling time that we might add to the delivery.

Our systems are updated as soon as we get the data back from the external resource, which is sometimes well after your product has been shipped. When time is of the essence, we place the priority on getting the product to you rather than updating our records because, in the end, getting the product to you is what it is all about.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So hopefully, this means that they&#039;ve actually in the process of shipping their copies of the expansion and just haven&#039;t gotten around to the website.

I&#039;ll cross my fingers and hope that it shows up on Monday - providing they used FedEx to ship it, of course.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[EBGames/GameStop/whoever else they are claim they are shipping on the 16th.  So if you have overnight shipping, it will arrive in the 17th. Of course, they&#039;re selling it in their stores at midnight on the 16th ... so you&#039;ll get it about 36 hours after it goes on sale.  Wasn&#039;t that overnight shipping worth it?

Or so the person I talked to in the CS department tells me.  I&#039;m upset about the whole thing.  In the past, they have indeed generally gotten the package to me on release day rather than shipping on release day so I&#039;ll have it at some nebulous future date.]]></description>
