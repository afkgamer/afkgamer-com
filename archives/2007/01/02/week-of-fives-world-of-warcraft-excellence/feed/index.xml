					<description><![CDATA[I am really happy to see someone acknowledge some of the great parts of World of Warcraft.  Typically all you hear day-in and day-out is people complaining to the high heavens about things that really shouldn&#039;t be complained about.  Rarely you&#039;ll get the well formed writing about what really is wrong and should be fixed/updated with the game, but it is so incredibly uncommon to see people praising the things that really deserve it about the game.  Well done Foton!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A very good list. In the rush to complain about things (ranting is so much more fun!) it&#039;s easy to forget to mention why we still enjoy and play the game. The fluff, sly humor, and system of teaching low-level chars to use the game through questing are some of my favorite parts of the game.]]></description>
