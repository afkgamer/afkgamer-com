					<description><![CDATA[Oh, I forgot to mention that when I called up Sony&#039;s tech support to see what was going on, and to see if they supported dual core or SLI/Quad SLI (at the time I didn&#039;t know)  the techs solution to my problem was to buy a new video card that didn&#039;t have SLI and maybe the game would run better. All I said to him was &quot;are you guys going to buy me a new video card because Sigil programmers are morons?&quot; and hung up on him.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I still can&#039;t believe the the retard programmers at Sigil Games didn&#039;t think to put dual core support and SLI / Quad SLI support for a game that takes that much processing power for both CPU and GPU.

It&#039;s utterly sad that my AMD FX-62 with 2GB of Mushkin DDR2 and Quad SLI XFX Geforce 7950 GX2 can&#039;t make Vancrap run without PC lag.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sadly, Vantard (bwa ha!) does not support SLI at this time, so those of you griping about poor performance with your leet SLI set up are really only using one card - hence the poor performance. APparently full suport for dual core, SLI and Vista will be added early in release. Even more sadly, I am one of those people with a SLI set up, my second card neglected. A*sigh*]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[liquid cooled dual core 4800 overclocked to 6000 with twin 7800&#039;s (yer I know so ... 2006 :P) overclocked by 20% each, 2gig of memory, 100 gig 10k rpm drives x 2 and still ... Vanguard runs like a bag of shit.  I zone (yer it&#039;s supposed to be seamless ... my arse) it takes 2 mins of pure lock up while I load the next part of the world.  I run on medium settings with the distance pulled right down just to get an acceptable frame rate.

After all that it looks cack, EQ2 full settings (minus a few shadows) will run flawlessly, I wont even mention what frame rate I get from all the latest games because it&#039;s not an issues, but it is with vanguard.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[LOL, I made an entire post on my blog a few weeks ago, based on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyndre.blogspot.com/2007/01/i-am-vanguarded.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Vanguard pun&lt;/a&gt;.   What about the title makes it so easy to do that?

In my post I Vandalize the quality of play...  oh zing!]]></description>
