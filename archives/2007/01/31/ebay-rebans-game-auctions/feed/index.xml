					<description><![CDATA[[...] At the end of last month, eBay confirmed that they intend to pull every auction for &#8216;virtual artifacts&#8217; from their site. From WoW gold to Neopoints, Real Money Transfer (RMT) fans will have to look elsewhere for their goodies. While initially I found this a fascinating move, after having it pointed out to me that eBay has threatened this before (many times before, in fact) I had to re-evaluate. Worldwide, RMT is a multimillion (billion?) dollar business now. The success of World of Warcraft has made companies like IGE buckets of profit, while outfits like Second Life and Entropia are drawing the attention of non-gamers to the possibilities of virtual currency. The last time eBay threatened this, there hadn&#8217;t been serious discussions of taxing your virtual property put forward by the U.S. government, and Sony Online wasn&#8217;t running its own virtual sales service. With new information on SOE&#8217;s business now out in the open, it&#8217;s easy to see that the very few auctions processed by Ebay are chump change compared to organized, RMT-specific services.

					<description><![CDATA[[...] Here&#8217;s the deal: Lum mentions eBay may be delisting VW stuff on Thursday. Later that day, I hunt down the media contact number for eBay and give them a call, which resulted in a post to Slashdot on Friday. It was one of the few chances I&#8217;ve had to create original non-review content for Slashdot, and I enjoyed it. On Monday C&#124;Net continued the story, by asking the &#8216;duh&#8217; question I&#8217;d neglected to ask the eBay rep: &#8220;So, does that include Second Life?&#8221; The answer being no, Giga Gamez points out something CNet has missed as well: eBay and 2L are sorta-in-bed via eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. With the dust starting to settle Van Hemlock does a couple of quick searches, noting that Second Life doesn&#8217;t have that much stuff on eBay anyway (making that part of the story not that interesting), and then Foton points out that eBay has said they&#8217;ll do this before. Like, several times. Which I really wish I&#8217;d remembered when I saw Scott&#8217;s post in the first place, and stayed off the phone. Oh well. [...]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The blogosphere could use a lot more Chas and less me. Read his outstanding post surrounding the recent brouhaha on the Pope&#039;s speech on media. It breaks down the facts and proves once again the masses are quick to judge and blow shit way out of proportion. 

 I had same similar thoughts. If &lt;em&gt;Ebay&lt;/em&gt; is implementing more efficient measures to help them enforce a RMT ban, what are the real motivations behind it? (Is it legal implications from some massive force about to crush their piggy-bank and make mommy and daddy cry?) And no, the furry conspiracy doesn&#039;t count. 

I like GBM more than RMT.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Chas, you just explained it better than any other recent post/article I&#039;ve read.

I still think it&#039;s all about smoke and mirrors, and eBay&#039;s slice of the MMOG black market was immaterial anyways, but appreciate your explanation and commentary.

Now if it turns out that Blizzard is prepping to toss out some lawsuits and they were unwilling to take on eBay, legally, then we&#039;ll have a good story.

And I&#039;ve always wondered that ... either put up and start suing the big players in the MMOGBM (MMOG Black Market, I call &#169; on that acronym), or shut up.]]></description>
