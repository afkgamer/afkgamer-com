					<description><![CDATA[Hahah, I just got those for my priest and I love them! It was great showing them off to my other half&#039;s pally... muahahhaa. They cover up just a little bit more than the &#039;naked&#039; pants, apart from more leg covering around from the knee down. Awesome.

They obviously haven&#039;t tried on the Raptorbane Armor either... as it *bare*ly covered anything up on my rather lovely buxom dwarf ]]></description>
