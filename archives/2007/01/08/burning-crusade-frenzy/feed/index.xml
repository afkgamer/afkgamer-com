					<description><![CDATA[Blizzard store is out-of-stock on both regular and collector&#039;s versions of The Burning Crusade.  (Guildmate tipped me to that, but I checked myself, cuz he&#039;s a paladin and we all know how unreliable they can be).

EBGames had regular versions available earlier today -- forgot to order a copy for my nephews&#039; account.  (OK, so I procrastinated too!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jason,
Blizzard has already started free opt-in transfers for selected severs, but the destination is fixed.  ppl on Alleria can transfer to Baelgun for free.   From what I&#039;ve read on my guilds website (I&#039;m on hiatus from WoW), queue counts were getting close to 500+.  This is open to multiple high population servers, and new account creation capabilities for these &quot;new&quot; servers will be disabled for the time being.
  
Although less queue time = less jackholes to deal with, it&#039;s rumored Baelgun doesn&#039;t have AQ open yet.  So be sure to look before you leap if your sever happens to have a free transfer window open up.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Blergh. Hope they don&#039;t split my server. *sigh*

I&#039;m a horrid procrastinator, but even I ordered copies for myself and my husband from Amazon back in... March? May? one of those M-months last year.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hope they plan on offering free server moves to some people... it would suck if, while both my account and my wife&#039;s accounts are cancelled, they split our characters up to different servers so we&#039;d have to start over or pay to play together again.  If it came to that, I don&#039;t think I&#039;d every play WoW again.]]></description>
