					<description><![CDATA[I want to play Vanguard... I do.  My computer, however, simply refuses to run the game.  Okay, it runs it, but the character creator had trouble loading.  It was sloooooow.  Meanwhile, my PC just loves WoW, zip zip zip!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[(EQ2 vs WoW) II [parenthesised for clarity]: The Second Fall. Yeah, this has mistake written all over it in rainbow-coloured highlighters. Applied to get into the Euro beta as it went up last night...not many keys going though, so we&#039;ll have to see. I&#039;m liking a few ideas this game has, but really don&#039;t know enough about it. Opinions guys? From the videos I&#039;ve seen, it seems to have a few graphical issues (players striking at flying mobs and clearly not hitting, etc), but some promising features (player housing, shops, etc). Definitely gonna give it a go.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve also been in beta, but for quite sometime and the overhaul the game has just &#039;recently&#039; had is immense and it&#039;s just not ready for release.  If they do release it then, well it is suicide really.  Did they not learn with Eq2 vs WoW in the first place?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Eardon, are you off your meds again?  I&#039;ve only spent a few hours in the VG beta and I can&#039;t see it hitting the streets in January unless suicide is what someone wants.  It&#039;s just not ready.  Perhaps they&#039;re going to hire Santa&#039;s Elves as late nite workers to pull it off.  With inflation and all, even elves need a little extra cash.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[OR
Maybe they didn&#039;t really decide that it was going to be publiced at that date, no one infact did, no human that is. For t&#039;was TEH ALIEN OVERLORD!!1 who haxxored their network, and by doing that sabotaged their game.
You see, it is a common fact that TEH ALIEN OVERLORD!!1 controls Blizzard. He is the reason that they have included spaceships (lolz) into TBC, infact, he looks a lot like the draenei, only different.
And because TEH ALIEN OVERLORD!!1 is a greedy bastard, he wish to sweep away any competition in the race against total geek-dominance.
IT&#039;S IN REVELATIONS PEOPLE!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yup its the real release date.  Some think SOE is forcing Sigil to release at the same time as the Burning Crusade in an attempt to sabotage it.  After all a lot of Sigil employees would probably find themselves working for SOE again if Sigil went down in flames.

The other theory is like what Ryan mentioned above.  Sigil knows that only hardcore players who aren&#039;t really fans of WoW will play their game.  Thus they don&#039;t really see any need to hold back the release date anymore since rumors say they are hurting for cash.  With a lot of their fans already having all-access passes from SOE they just need to move the boxes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If that&#039;s the correct date, they&#039;ll have a hell of a challenge on their hands. However, a lot of the audience is separate, so I think they&#039;ll still get most of their hardcore players upfront, even if the others don&#039;t follow until/unless they get bored with Burning Crusade (or whatever other game they are playing at the time).]]></description>
