					<description><![CDATA[I ordered mine from Amazon, and according to them, it will show up on the 17th.  Now, in the event that it doesn&#039;t, I won&#039;t be particularly upset.  In all honesty, I really don&#039;t expect the game to be playable on the 16th, I just don&#039;t see how they could have a trouble free launch.  I mean, even with patch 2.0 things were pretty screwed up, how could TBC be any better?  I&#039;m still leveling my priest alt and having a blast with that so worse case scenario I can still play with that character.  

If anything it gives my relationship another couple of days before it completely implodes under the weight of MMO goodness.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You just described what I&#039;ll likely be doing Tuesday morning, sans suit. I&#039;m banking that large outlets like Fry&#039;s/Best Buy will simply have them sitting on the shelves...

I better make some phone calls...]]></description>
