					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Not so sure thats the issue ... let alone it being an &#039;obvious&#039; one. Nonetheless, the guys gotta grow a pair and tell his woman to chill.&quot;

Well a reasonable person does not get mad at a man because the character he plays in a video game is a female.  The problem could be that she is mad at him for spending so much time in the game, that she is one ugly beast in real life and she believes his character is what he wants in a woman, or that she is simply displacing other frustrations onto the game.  That&#039;s just a few of the possibilities. 

 My wife occasionally goes absolutely nuts over the smallest things and it&#039;s never really about the small thing.  One time I changed the channel while she was going to the bathroom and she came back and went crazy on me.  Turns out she was mad about me saying something mean (but true) about her friend and the channel changing is just what set her off.

Most women (in my experience) who get married or move in with someone for the first time claim they don&#039;t expect it to be a neverending date, but somewhere in the back of their minds, they do.  He could be playing too much or she could just be a needy bitch. Who knows?  I&#039;d place my money on him spending too much time killing monsters when he should be paying attention to his bride.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Obviously the issue is elsewhere. He&#039;s probably spending his evenings in BWL when he should be in the bedroom doing what newlyweds do.&quot;

Not so sure thats the issue... let alone it being an &#039;obvious&#039; one.  Nonetheless, the guys gotta grow a pair and tell his woman to chill. That, or do as the quoted poster said:

&quot;The best advice I can give you is do whatever your wife tells you, because god knows you&#039;re never going to get that far with another woman again, EVER.&quot;  

ROFL!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Believe it or not, when my husband and I first got married there was some gaming-related...friction. He was a gamer, I was not. Up to that point, he had always done his gaming after I left or was studying, etc. The difference being, of course, that after the wedding I was ALWAYS around. ;) So being jealous of the TIME spent gaming (instead of interacting) I can somewhat relate to, up to a point at least (I did get over it after all). 

Having issues with it being a female toon though?....Even I&#039;m not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; crazy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow. Boggles the mind.

Some of my husband&#039;s toons are females... when I play on one of my male toons I flirt with them. ;) We both have toons of each gender. The male toons are at least as unrealistic in appearance, if that&#039;s what the wife is worried about--but somehow, I don&#039;t think that&#039;s the breaking point here...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think the real issue here is....How the hell do you get married to someone and not know eachother&#039;s hobbies?  It boggles my mind.  Shouldn&#039;t he have found out if his wife-to-be would get jealous of pixels on a computer screen before he married her?
