					<description><![CDATA[FFS, what is with the deletion of original posts lately?  Since the OP&#039;s other responses in that thread are still viewable (UNLIKE the &quot;my old EQ buddy was murdered&quot; thread earlier this week), I&#039;m wondering if there&#039;s a bug that deletes #0 of long threads or if evil gnomes are involved.

Anyways, the original post is available (as stated above) in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/afkgamer/368958487/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Flickr screenie&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s a world of difference between &quot;Your account has been locked for suspicious activity. Please call 1-800-WE PWND U for assistance.&quot; and &quot;Your account has been nuked in our scorched earth policy. Please buy another box so we can continue to swim in our money pool.&quot;

It looks like the original post has been removed, so I can&#039;t tell which case this one is. But the first one is fairly reasonable, while the second is just insane.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s stupid and they should do some serious checking before banning the account.  I travel regularly and do access WOW while out of town,  so I&#039;d have IPs from all over the US and possibly Asia.  I&#039;ve been on WOW during this trip,  just can&#039;t access BC until I get back home and tear open the box that&#039;s waiting.

WOW is way too popular for them to has such narrow terms.  They actually have professionals playing this game and we can be as obssessive about getting online as any teen sitting at home popping pimples.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know my husband has gamed while on business trips to places as far away as Singapore and not had a problem, but it&#039;s been a while since he&#039;s been on one of those trips, so if it&#039;s a change in policy, or he just happened to fit under some threshold for frequency/number of countries...

I think gold- and account-buying is stupid and takes away the point of the game, but I&#039;m not rabid about thinking it ruins the economy or something ridiculous like that. There are plenty of ways to counteract the effects of such deals on the economy if you&#039;re willing to put a little time &#038;/or effort into it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, in this guy&#039;s case, it seems like they geo-ID&#039;d the IPs and saw several countries over a short period of time.  I haven&#039;t heard of anyone with a dynamic IP getting banned, (maybe that&#039;s to come), that&#039;s why I suspect Blizz is ID&#039;ing the IPs somehow and something (quantity, big geo area) is bothering them about the pattern.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Are they serious?? That scares me...
I play from several IPs in the UK and Cyprus...home, friends, relatives, work... I thought I was lucky to have a super duper laptop for mobile-WoW (especially as I live in a tiny cypriot village with a less-than-desirable connection) but maybe not.

Ech. I wonder how many different IPs and how often before you get banned :/]]></description>
