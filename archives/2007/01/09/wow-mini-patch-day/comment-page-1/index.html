Druids and rogues have their talents refunded, the Auction House now sorts items by buy-out price to aid the click-happy among us, hunters get a boost, there&#8217;s some changes to the UI API (may require updates to your addons, depending), plus MORE!</p>
<p>Patch notes after the jump.</p>
<p>EDIT:  See Also:  Warcraft Forums &#8211; <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=63766544&#038;sid=1">Undocumented Changes</a>, Patch 2.0.3, including the Warlock &#8220;adjustment&#8221;</p>
<p><span id="more-1321"></span><strong>World of Warcraft Client Patch 2.0.3</strong></p>
<p>The latest patch notes can always be found at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/implemented/</p>
<p><strong>The Burning Crusade</strong></p>
<p>      Several years have passed since the Burning Legion&#8217;s defeat at the Battle of Mount Hyjal &#8211; and the races of Azeroth have continued to rebuild their once shattered kingdoms. With renewed strength, the heroes of the Horde and Alliance have begun to explore the broken lands beyond the Dark Portal. What dangers or rewards await mortal champions in Draenor? And what will the Alliance and Horde do when they discover that the demons they thought vanquished have returned to renew their terrible Burning Crusade?<br />
<strong><br />
General</strong></p>
<p>    * A stirring of events has begun throughout Azeroth and rumor points to the Dark Portal as its source.<br />
    * Mazk Snipeshot in Booty Bay now sells bullets.<br />
    * The Auction House now sorts by buyout price first, then by current price. This should filter all of the items with outlandish buyout prices to the bottom of the list.<br />
    * Players will now need to be level 58 to pass through the Dark Portal. (The Burning Crusade Expansion must be installed.)<br />
    * Collector Edition pets are now blue items and a confirmation dialogue will appear to prevent accidental deletion.<br />
    * Pets will no longer attack targets that are under the influence of crowd control (sheep, banish, etc.).<br />
    * The title &#8220;Scarab Lord&#8221; can now be chosen in game for select players. </p>
<p><strong>PvP</strong></p>
<p>    * Players can use the /teamquit or /teamdisband command in order to leave an Arena team.<br />
    * A new bracket has been added to Alterac Valley for level 61-70.<br />
    * Added a sorting function so that the battleground and scoreboard can be sorted by any of the categories.<br />
    * Healthstones and summoned warlock pets will no longer cost a soulshard to summon in the Arena preparation area. All summoned items and pets will be dismissed on leaving the arena.<br />
    * The last pet a player had summoned will be resummoned outside the Arena upon leaving. </p>
<p><strong>Druids</strong></p>
<p>    * Due to various talent changes, all Druids will have all their talent points refunded.<br />
    * &#8220;Feline Swiftness&#8221; has been renamed &#8220;Feral Swiftness&#8221;. The dodge % increase now also applies to Bear and Dire Bear Forms.<br />
    * &#8220;Improved Moonfire&#8221; has been reduced to 2 ranks, for a 5/10% bonus.<br />
    * &#8220;Insect Swarm&#8221; has had its damage on all ranks increased. The mana cost of ranks 1 and 3 has been increased. The mana cost of ranks 4,5 and 6 has been decreased.<br />
    * &#8220;Nurturing Instinct&#8221; now grants its benefit at all times, but the bonus has been reduced to 25/50% of Strength.<br />
    * &#8220;Improved Starfire&#8221; has been renamed to &#8220;Celestial Focus&#8221; and now also increases the chance to resist casting pushback when casting Wrath by 25/50/70%.<br />
    * &#8220;Blood Frenzy&#8221; benefits have merged with &#8220;Primal Fury&#8221;.<br />
    * &#8220;Improved Leader of the Pack&#8221; has been reduced to 2 ranks for 2/4% total health healed.<br />
    * &#8220;Pounce&#8221; no longer requires the druid to be behind the target.<br />
    * &#8220;Barkskin&#8221; is now usable while stunned.<br />
    * Druids now need substantially less agility per dodge.<br />
    * &#8220;Dire Bear Form&#8221; armor bonus increased to 450% and health bonus changed to a 25% percent health increase instead of a flat increase.<br />
    * The Health bonus of &#8220;Bear Form&#8221; has changed to a 25% percent health increase instead of a flat increase.<br />
    * &#8220;Swipe&#8221; has had its threat bonus multiplier removed.<br />
    * &#8220;Maul&#8221; has had its threat bonus multiplier changed to a flat value similar in threat per time to &#8220;Heroic Strike&#8221;.<br />
    * &#8220;Regrowth&#8221; has had its mana cost reduced by approximately 18%.<br />
    * &#8220;Tree of Life&#8221; healing bonus now increases the healing received by your party members instead of the healing dealt by your party members.<br />
    * The &#8220;Tranquility&#8221; base amount healed per second has increased by approximately 273%. The radius of effect has increased from 20 yards 30 yards. Mana cost has increased by 40%. The Cooldown has increased from 5 minutes to 10 minutes. The Duration has decreased from 10 seconds to 8 seconds.<br />
    * &#8220;Mangle&#8221; will not stack multiple copies from multiple forms or druids anymore. This was never intended behavior. The percentage modification on bleeds has increased from 25% to 30% and &#8220;Mangle&#8221; now increases the damage from &#8220;Shred&#8221; as well. In addition, &#8220;Mangle&#8221; will now benefit from the damage boost from &#8220;Tiger&#8217;s Fury&#8221;.<br />
    * &#8220;Enrage&#8221; will now show up in the combat log and in floating combat text.<br />
    * &#8220;Lifebloom&#8221; will now correctly consume clearcasting.<br />
    * &#8220;Predatory Instincts&#8221; has had its tooltip adjusted to indicate it only works in feral forms, and that it increases damage by a percent, not damage bonus by a percent.<br />
    * If a spell is resisted, it will no longer break stealth.<br />
    * &#8220;Tree of Life&#8217;s&#8221; bonus healing aura will now reactivate correctly when &#8220;Banish&#8221; wears off.<br />
    * Shapeshifted druids will now be able to speak to npcs while shapeshifted. </p>
<p><strong>Hunters</strong></p>
<p>    * &#8220;Multi-Shot&#8221; has had its mana cost adjusted back to a value closer to its pre-2.0.1 version.<br />
    * If your pet has been recently revived by using &#8220;Call Pet&#8221;, it will no longer reset back to full health.<br />
    * If a Hunter &#8220;Wyvern Stings&#8221; an enemy already asleep from &#8220;Wyvern Sting&#8221;, the &#8220;Wyvern Sting&#8221; sleep will now be reapplied correctly. </p>
<p><strong>Mages</strong></p>
<p>    * &#8220;Frost Nova&#8221; (Water Elemental Spell) has been renamed to &#8220;Freeze&#8221;.<br />

          o Players that experience poor system performance can set &#8220;Hardware Acceleration=OFF&#8221; which may improve performance but will disable any EAX (reverberation) effects supported by their sound card.<br />

    * API Changes<br />
          o NEW: Dismount()<br />

          o NEW: link = GetInboxItemLink(index)<br />
          o NEW: button = GetMouseButtonClicked() &#8212; Returns the name of the button that triggered a mouse down/up/click/doubleclick event.<br />
          o NEW: hasMacro = CursorHasMacro()<br />
          o NEW: &#8220;item&#8221;, itemID, link = GetCursorInfo() OR &#8220;spell&#8221;, slot, &#8220;spell&#8221; or &#8220;pet&#8221; = GetCursorInfo() OR &#8220;macro&#8221;, index = GetCursorInfo() OR &#8220;money&#8221;, amount = GetCursorInfo()<br />
    * Macro Features<br />
          o NEW: /dismount<br />
          o /castsequence will equip items if they need to be equipped, and use them otherwise.<br />
          o The following commands now support the [target=unit] macro option syntax: /startattack, /petattack, /target, /assist, /focus<br />
          o If you add a #showtooltip line to your macro, it will show the tooltip of the item or spell in addition to the normal visual feedback.<br />
          o A unit&#8217;s name can be used anywhere a unit token can be used. e.g. if you had the player Desmondia in your party, /cast [target=Desmondia] Flash Heal, would cast Flash Heal on her. This will only work for the player, pet, party members and pets, and raid members and pets. You can use &#8220;-target&#8221; or &#8220;-pet&#8221; to indicate the target or pet of the named unit, e.g. /cast [target=Desmondia-target,harm] Shadow Word: Pain<br />
    * Key Bindings<br />

          o NEW: name = Tooltip:GetUnit()<br />
          o NEW: name, link = Tooltip:GetItem()<br />
          o NEW: name, rank = Tooltip:GetSpell()<br />
          o Added several script handlers which are called when the tooltip is set to a unit, item, or spell: OnTooltipSetUnit, OnTooltipSetItem, OnTooltipSetSpell<br />
    * Cooldown Indicators<br />
          o There&#8217;s a new cooldown indicator frame that replaces the previous model file. The old syntax: <model inherits="CooldownFrameTemplate"/> should be replaced by <cooldown inherits="CooldownFrameTemplate"/><br />
    * Secure Templates<br />

          o Unit frames will respond to modified clicks by default.<br />
          o Action buttons no longer use shift-click to pick up actions, but instead use shift-drag. This frees up the shift modifier for use in macros or as a self-cast modifier.<br />

          o Fixed /reply in macros<br />
          o Fixed a bug where /petattack would target the nearest unit, not the nearest live enemy unit.<br />
          o The macro &#8220;button:N&#8221; conditional will work with either the real button clicked or the state-header-remapped button that launched the macro.<br />
          o /click now works with secure action buttons<br />

<p>&#8230;and how do we feel about that? I read it was only nerfed with regards to +spell damage items. Is it a more global nerf?</p>
