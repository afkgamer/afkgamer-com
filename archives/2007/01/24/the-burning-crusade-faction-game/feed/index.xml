					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Guys, all those rewards will be stupid easy to replace once raiding starts at any meaningful level. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

You haven&#039;t done much raiding have you?

The aldor blade I suggested is 80+ dps which is equivelent to the best drops seen in the game to date, and if it&#039;s something I can do in my downtime from raiding I will try and get it.

Blizzards aversion to good rogue weapons dropping seems beyond me really, we went 11months with no perditions blade (even running our alts through MC never saw one), took us 7 months to get a single Chromatically tempered sword and a further 5 months in AQ40 (oh the torture) to get a single AQRipper, although the rates of Iblis and Maex fang were allot better (like 1 in 15 for us) seems that Blizzard just doesn&#039;t like see&#039;ing weapons drops.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Guys, all those rewards will be stupid easy to replace once raiding starts at any meaningful level.  The only faction reward with any gear scalability that is worth looking at are the shoulder enchants.

Choose the faction with the shoulder enchant that best compliments your class, and go that way.  Everything else will be available from the 123847262748 other blacsmiths on your server if you &#039;really&#039; feel you needed it, which you won&#039;t.

For my money, I went Scrye, because the crit on the caster enchant seems to have more scalability long term, than the straight damage boost from the Aldor enchant.   I haven&#039;t looked much at the other classes, but my wife tells me Aldor is teh place to be for healing priests.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So the imba healing staff is on the Scryer side and damage is on Aldor.
The healing tailoring reward is on the Aldor side and damage is on Scryer.

What gives?

Leaning towards Aldor as at least my pally can benefit from that one too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For me the choice is based on Blacksmithing.  Each faction offers tradeskill plans, with the Aldor set being a fire resistance set and the Scryer set being Arcane resistance.  As I&#039;m sure you know, no raids or encounters outside of possibly Shaz (and I mean cmon, it&#039;s Shaz) have required any arcane resistance, so maybe the Scryer set foreshadows an upcoming encounter where arcane resistance will play a role.  This could make that Scryer set more attractive for crafters.

More important to me that the stats of the items are the blacksmithing level and components involved in creating them.  These pieces become craftable starting at 350 for Aldor and 355 for Scryer, and go up to 365 for Aldor and 360 for Scryer.  At this level, blacksmithing becomes quite expensive in terms of materials required, and the Aldor set required Fel Iron/Primals, while the Scryer set requires Hardened Adamantite/Shards.  It takes an entire stack of Adamantite ore to create one Hardened Adamantite bar.  At this point it would appear that  the Scryer set will cost more to make than the Aldor, and the Aldor breastplate will remain orange (crafting skillup)  for longer than the Scryer set.  This has me leaning toward Aldor, plus you can get a pretty nice tanking chest from them as well.  

Having said that, I&#039;m holding out as long as I can before making a decision, and still have yet to decide.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a hunter with engineering, both factions are not that appealing. So I chose Aldor for lore reason. Even though I am on a PVE server. 

I am seriously hoping that blizzz adds some better items to those loot tables in the future. 
Nothing is in stone when it comes to wow; and blizzards approach to the game (see, a space ship crash landing off the coast of Darkshore)]]></description>
