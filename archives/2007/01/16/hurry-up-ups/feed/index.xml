					<description><![CDATA[@Gemma

It looks like you may have used an open tag character in your &quot;frustrated face&quot; emote.  I wouldn&#039;t be suprised if it was mistaken for a special character, which would result in the rest of your post being cut off.  I don&#039;t think they&#039;re big on censorship around here.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It snowed today, and where I live two inches of snow = no school. Whoopee!
Unfortunately, where I live is a town away from any store that sells anything like TBC, and my parents are reluctant about driving anywhere in the snow because their car sucks.

I know I should have my own car and license by now, but I don&#039;t. I scraped together the $40 needed and begged my parents to take me to get the damn thing. After a lot of arguing, the father figure finally agrees to take me. It wasn&#039;t so easy, though. Lectures all the way there, lectures all the way back. &quot;It&#039;s dangerous to drive in the snow without 4-wheel drive,&quot; he says. &quot;If we&#039;re pulled over and they find out I don&#039;t have any insurance we&#039;re screwed,&quot; he says.

Once we&#039;re finally to the only store in the town we drove to that carries the game, there aren&#039;t any boxes on the shelves and I ask the guy at the register if they have any left. Now this guy has absolutely no idea what I&#039;m talking about. World of Whatcraft? Uhhh... yeah, I think we got a few of those a few days ago. None on the shelves? Why don&#039;t you look again to make sure, I&#039;ll check if we have any in the back.
So we glance over the same wall of computer games again(hey, I say to myself, they have GW: Nightfall Collector&#039;s Edition, now if only I wasn&#039;t so poor), and come back to the register to find a guy with a head on his shoulders. The other guy was still in the back not knowing exactly what he was looking for. I ask this new guy if they have any. He knows exactly what I&#039;m talking about, and tells me they sold out. Well, they didn&#039;t just sell out, they sold out about ten hours ago.

Lady Luck is having fun kicking me in the teeth and I&#039;m having fun watching people enjoy the new content without me. My thoughts on said content:

Draenei: Finally something on ally better looking than night elves. If you ask me, male night elves are just grody. The shaman is one of my favorite classes and I&#039;ll definitely be jumping aboard the shammy bandwagon.
Blood Elves: Finally all the n00blets who love night elves will have a reason to make Horde characters, meaning ally may actually have a chance at WSG and AB now.

Sure, there are tons of Horde pallies and Ally shammies now, but at least they&#039;re not hunters. My server has an obscene hunter infestation, about 25% of all characters on the server are hunters.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ok i&#039;ll be happier when there&#039;s a level difference again...too many damn people running around. I don&#039;t care if i&#039;m behind them or in front of them just as long as there aren&#039;t as many of them.

Oh and what is it about rolling a new toon that makes everyone forget how to play? Perfect example, a quest in the Dranei lands that involves killing X amount of mobs, instead of 5 people teaming and getting the X amount of mobs they need at once, they instead kill alone and multiply the amount of mobs needed ot be killed by 5, and increasing the length of time it takes for everyone (including themselves) to finish the damn quest. It&#039;s not like these are new players, yet they forget one of the basic rules of WoW  questing common sense because they are level 1 ugh.

And I repeat again, there&#039;s about 5 million new shamans and paladins.]]></description>
