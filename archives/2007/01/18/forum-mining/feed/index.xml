					<description><![CDATA[Eh, I never really bought into the whole one side is easier than other arguments.  They both have their downsides.  Personally I like doing fights without fear ward.  Nef on alliance side is boring, Nef on horde side is fun.  Zerk rage rotation actually makes tanking that fight interesting.

There&#039;s immaturity on both sides, the trick is to keep it out of your guild.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As for re-rolling to a BE... *shudder* I can&#039;t stand the idea. From what I&#039;ve seen so far of the appearances/emotes/etc., they just make me think of cheerleaders gone bad (wait was that redundant?). On the other hand, I love the Draenei.

The EZ mode discussions always amuse the hell out of me. I&#039;ve seen each side claim the other one has it easy. I can&#039;t count the number of &quot;well &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt; knows Blizzard prefers Horde&quot; things I&#039;ve heard on Alliance side, and vice versa. Grass is always greener and all that, like you said. It reminds me of a player I know. He&#039;s a die-hard pvper, and he&#039;s always on about this or that class which is overpowered in PvP. As soon as he levels that class up though, it&#039;s suddenly a different class that&#039;s overpowered.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve now played one year as Horde and one year as Alliance. And I can definitively say... they&#039;re both a wild mix of maturity. I gather it does differ a bit depending on server; if you happen to get a crowd of very loud kids who all roll on your server at once and pick the same side, well, you&#039;ll hear them loudest on general chat just by nature, so that side will seem particularly bad. Perhaps there are slightly different &lt;i&gt;kinds&lt;/i&gt; of maturity and immaturity, but even there that&#039;s an over-generalization; at most it&#039;s a slight tendency rather than a real trend I think.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[From what I&#039;ve seen, the immature players are most often the lowbies. People under level 40. Both sides have immature players like this, but as you go up in level, the immature players seem to weed themselves out, maybe because they&#039;re the type of people who don&#039;t like spending a lot of time playing a video game or the type of people who can&#039;t deal with an MMO&#039;s lack of instant gratification, I don&#039;t know; but there seem to be far fewer immature players that are level 60(and now, 60+).

I will say, however, that there seem to be more immature night elves than any other race, and I constantly see them insulting the Horde senselessly(&quot;lolol the whorde r pussies they need gud racielz cuz theyd suk @ pvp w/o em&quot;). I will admit, most shamefully, that my first character was a night elf druid, and my first days in Teldrassil were far from pleasant because of the extremely immature atmosphere. I only venture into Teldrassil past Darnassus if I have reason to believe there&#039;s a flagged Hordie in there, otherwise that place can kiss my ass.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Alliance EZMode thing has been rehashed so many times and any reasonably arguments, if you ever believed them (which I did), are now moot with TBC giving horde paladins.  Now it&#039;s just down to racials, and really those aren&#039;t very important in PvE.

The theory is most kids and noobs (in the true sense of the word) will pick the familiar, aesthetically pleasing, &#039;good&#039; race, and anytime you have population imbalance you always always always want to be on the down side.  Obviously there are all kinds on both side, but personally I think when comparing horde/alliance, Albion/Midgard, Glorious Lord vs Dread Lord, etc, the less mainstream faction will tend to be more polarized between good, mature players and total asshats just looking to grief.  This is always a good thing, compared to the other side which is the middle ground of players who are more whiny and immature but basically decent.]]></description>
