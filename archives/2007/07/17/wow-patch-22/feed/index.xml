You arena, and you describe sap as your only form of crowd control?

You do have snares, blind, stun, and gouge that went unmolested.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;blackhawk&quot;&gt;Sap being reduced to ten seconds is a small sacrifice in order to get the &quot;bug fix&quot; of pets breaking off their attack when you vanish.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Actually to be honest I&#039;ve never really come across the pet bug thing in a long time, one because I play arena&#039;s and two I only use vanish a way to stealth very quickly before I stun again :).

So really our only form of Crowd control that has been nerfed for four patches running is nerfed again whilst other forms are left untouched as usual.  Just like all of our other forms of immobilization it&#039;s all been nerfed to hell meaning that rogues are far less use in pvp than ever before.  What do I care?  I only play my 5 man arena for a few measly points a week saving for some offhand to replace my blue sword (Latro&#039;s ftl) that I&#039;ve had for 6months.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;strong&gt;The following old-world factions have had their acquisition rate significantly increased: Cenarion Circle, Argent Dawn, Timbermaw Hold.&lt;/strong&gt;

Holy cow, does this make me happy.  I&#039;m just about about ready to start grinding those factions on my Priest tailor/enchanter - guess I&#039;ll hold off a bit.]]></description>
