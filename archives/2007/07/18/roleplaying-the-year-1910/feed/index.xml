					<description><![CDATA[Gaming with the wife is fun. She and I both read AFK gamer, and based on Foton&#039;s advice and are almost done making the perfect characters. 

I have a 70 epiced rogue and she has a similarly geared Holy Priest in our raiding guild.

However, my prot warrior alt has just hit 60 and will be 70 soon.

We will become Foton&#039;s most dreaded combination. A Prot Warrior married to a Holy priest in a raiding guild. Muahahaha.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ha. If I wanted antiquated moral values I&#039;d get religion, not play a video game. Let&#039;s face it---gaming with your spouse is best because you always have someone to call on when you need another hand for an instance run. ;)]]></description>
