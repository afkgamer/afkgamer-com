					<description><![CDATA[I checked out guildcafe and it&#039;s cluttered like a CPAs desk during tax season. Horrible navigation control and just too much going on. On the other hand, I found http://www.mmosocial.com/ and very simple to navigate and just the right amount of features to keep me engaged. What ever happened to simple and purposeful?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, RalphDea. So cute. You commented on every site that posted something about this announcement on the 28th, in the same stretch of time, with a different name but the same silliness about &quot;virus scanners&quot; or &quot;keyloggers.&quot; Whose fanboy are you? All within the same block of time.

With more than seventeen thousand beta users, not one complaint about virus scanners going off has ever been received. Given how vocal some of the regulars are, let&#039;s just say... you&#039;re a troll. Try emailing an admin when something &quot;not imaginary&quot; happens.

Foton - the investment is because of the plans for the site, and the history of the founders. There isn&#039;t much built yet, I totally admit that, but IDG is a big player in terms of VC and doesn&#039;t invest lightly. And you already called it - they expect returns.

For that matter, *I* expect returns. I had a number of offers for my carcass after I left Mythic. I would not have taken this gig if all there was to GuildCafe is what shows on the site today. It&#039;s very much in development. The VC meant the founders could start hiring :)

Check back in a few months and email me, tell me what you think.]]></description>
