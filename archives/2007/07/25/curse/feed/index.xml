					<description><![CDATA[Curse is only reacting to Affinity Media/IGE/Allakhazam.  They have no vision or foresight and I doubt they will be much more than they are now, which isn&#039;t much.  They are behind the curve and trying to catch up by throwing the Curse owner&#039;s dads money at the problem.  This isnt VC money, this is his family&#039;s investment money.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Their news is written by 12 year olds and frequently outdated and sometimes just plain wrong, and usually I can pick it up quicker from other sources just by having my own RSS reader (which is probably what they do anyway).  There are better places to pick up mods these days (ACE svn anyone? :P), and allot of the mods listed are hardly updated now, due to other sites being more popular.

Don&#039;t see how they are going ot make back that sort of cash unless they start charging to download other peoples work and have access to their crappy news.]]></description>
