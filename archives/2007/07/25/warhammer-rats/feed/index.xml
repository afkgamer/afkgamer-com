					<description><![CDATA[Wow, this is pretty interesting.  I wonder how bad they are getting pummeled with email about possible violations. 

Its got to be crazy too trying to figure out who people are and how to link them to actual beta accounts.  Tough job I would imagine.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I guess the idea is that people are only going to want to talk about Warhammer with other people who&#039;re interested in the game -- people who are probably interested in playing the beta. I&#039;d like to hope that people were talking about it with their friends, though, and that friends wouldn&#039;t turn each other in simply to play a game Beta - but hey, perhaps I&#039;m naive ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[But I think that&#039;s exactly the implication. 

Turn in an NDA violator, get Beta ticket, profit.
