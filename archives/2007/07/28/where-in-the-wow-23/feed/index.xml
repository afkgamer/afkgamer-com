					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, the uber-complete ignore is great.  Sadly I feel incredibly bad using it on obnoxious guildies as I&#039;m an officer specifically to help the GM handle some of the routine member care and feeding drama (and no, I don&#039;t need to be told how incredibly stupid I was to take that job, I&#039;ve figured it out at this point).

That doesn&#039;t stop me from putting some of the extra obnoxious people on mute in vent, which has lead to some rather amusing moments where I&#039;ve just talked straight over whichever jackass is prattling on and I get like 3+ tells from folks who know I&#039;ve muted him/her saying, &quot;dude, he was actually just talking.&quot;  Fortunately this doesn&#039;t matter because the folks I mute are generally too self aborbed to even notice. :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This reminds me of crap some pally pulled in Kara not too long ago. Random roll on some epic or other, he lost, and then he spent the next two pulls literally pouting in a corner. I kid you not, he walked his toon over to a corner, sat down, and pouted. No heals, no buffs, no nothing. This, of course, earned him the nickname Pally McPoutyPants.

I can&#039;t imagine why this twat is giving you the silent treatment. Maybe she&#039;s heard of your blog and doesn&#039;t wanna say anything retarded to you that you might publish later? (Can&#039;t really say as though I blame her, if that&#039;s the case...) Or, maybe she&#039;s just doing it to irk you and get attention in the process? Who knows. She&#039;s still a stain on the WoW landscape.]]></description>
