					<description><![CDATA[I think the best solution writing a &quot;dear john&quot; letter about getting redeployed and having to quit, or better that &quot;her&quot; family is from the old country and she&#039;s being forced to marry her uncle and he doesn&#039;t like MMOs. Then delete the character. Something to give him fond memories of what could have been.

Maybe it&#039;s all in his head, you know how we guys think every women we meet are interested in us? I mean he said he only knew the guy for a couple hours, did the other guy let him have a drop off a mob and now he thinks that means something?

Of course, he posted about his predicament with his main? Huh?

I finally got so sick of the wierdos on my female toons I put &quot;I&#039;m a guy IRL&quot; in my descriptions in games like CoX.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ok, so you messed up and lied to a guy about being a girl (and probably lied to yourself about a couple things in the process), but your real error is posting about it on the freaking WoW forums. 

If you need a sympathetic audience for thoughtful and helpful advice about your stupid predicament, maybe Oprah has forums on her website. Until then, delete the toon and STFU about the whole affair, that&#039;s my advice.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;I&#039;ve never been in a relationship, real nor online, so I have no experience whatsoever with this.&quot;

Just kind of says it all.  

At least he hasn&#039;t developed an unhealthy relationship with his female toon and himself.  There appears to be some hope he&#039;ll find sunlight someday.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, and I hate to say it Foton, but I think it&#039;s your guild with the divorces. Jeez, man. I&#039;ve never seen an IRL marriage implode in-game before, and I&#039;ve gamed with quite a few married folks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[*blink,blink*

What I want to know is, why is his first thought, &quot;How do I keep up this charade without him finding out I&#039;m a guy?&quot; I mean, really, that&#039;s what his questions boil down to. I&#039;d think MY first thought---assuming I was dumb enough to get into that kind of situation, which I&#039;d like to think would be pretty damn small, I mean it&#039;s pretty hard to ACCIDENTALLY get into a relationship---would be, &quot;How do I get my ass out of this?!&quot;]]></description>
