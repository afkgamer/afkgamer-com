					<description><![CDATA[I liked Guk, but it was possibly the most annoying going there all the damn time with my brother (who at the time was a mage early on), Buggy pathing routes were the cause of many a death in that place, along with trains and idiots.

But I still do remember it with fondness, camping the FBSS (I think it was that... I&#039;m getting old memory ain&#039;t so good :P) for 32 hours straight for my monk.  And then the epic part down there as well for almost as equal amount of time.  As you can expect my familiarity with the zone and it&#039;s inhabitants was quite well versed.

I still prefered Chardok and more so Sebelis as a well designed dungeon.]]></description>
