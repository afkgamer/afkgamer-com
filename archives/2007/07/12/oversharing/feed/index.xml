And while once I used to think afk bio would be a bit too much info - we&#039;ve had enough people go afk during instances that yes, I want to know if it&#039;s bio, or computer problems, or the phone, or just wandering to the fridge when we need the dps or to peel adds off the healer. This way I know how irritated to be.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[like heather said, i think i block a lot of stuff out. we have a /xxx channel where ppl go who wanna share that kinda thing, so is it really &quot;oversharing&quot; if they&#039;re in a channel designed for exactly that purpose?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think I&#039;ve blocked out all the over-sharing from my old guild, and my current one doesn&#039;t tend to do that (it&#039;s a very laid-back guild, very much composed of actual, functional adults with jobs and such). The only thing I can remember from my current guild was a time when I was on one of my male toons---what can I say, I like variety---and a guildie started ranting about what bitches all women were (this from a guy who, in fact, still lived in his mother&#039;s basement).

I pointedly made a comment that it might not be wise to rant about that over guild chat when he couldn&#039;t know who was *actually* a guy or not, but he kept going, so I just ignored him. My guild wisely tends to just ignore folks who go off on jags like that, so when no one jumps to the bait they tend to move on to guilds that&#039;ll give them more sympathy. As it isn&#039;t a raiding guild, we don&#039;t have to worry about soothing the priest&#039;s ego. ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I thought I had a good one back from my Everquest days, but some of these others I&#039;ve read are along the same lines. I guess that is just what everyone &#039;Overshares&#039;

Anyways, back in an Everquest guild I was in, there was a married couple and the wife didn&#039;t work, so she was always online at home. Me being 14-15 at the time and not having anything better to do was right there with her, and needless to say she Overshared everything she could.

The kicker came when one of the other members of the guild came to stay with them for a vacation, she told me that she was cheating on her husband with the guy, and how much sex they were having while her husband was at work!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We get a lot of random drunk stories (there are days I strongly suspect that a large chunk of the non-minors in our guild are high functioning alcoholics, certainly a good portion of our officers are, though for some reason first kills usually happen after one of our key raiders says &quot;Fuck this noise, I&#039;m gonna start drinking&quot;), but some of our best oversharing ones are actually non-alcoholic and non-sexual.

One of our GL&#039;s and main raid leaders grew up on a farm, and plays from there when college term isn&#039;t in session, which leads to a variety of stories you don&#039;t really see coming.  Some of them are hilarious no matter how inconvenient to progression (somewhere in BWL - &quot;Shit, sheep jumped the fence&quot; GL has gone AFK), some are a little too much information (&quot;Dammit, goat just pissed on the floor&quot; &quot;Why the heck is it in the house and not, you know, in a barn?&quot; &quot;Well, it&#039;s got this deformed face and we kind of feel sorry for it&quot; &quot;...&quot;).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Girls who tell me that they are in a bad mood because it is that time, kinda bothers me.  The story that Curium told was pretty close to that other blog post that was made here.  It was about that guy that rolled a girl and then got stuck with an online boyfriend and didn&#039;t know how to tell him.  I guess this happens more than I thought.]]></description>
