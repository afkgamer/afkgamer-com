					<description><![CDATA[Our paladins (blood elf) spec holy and prot without hesitation.  When they spec for support, they simply support better than holy/disc priests.

Even if you bring no priests to Karazhan, healing cloth won&#039;t go to waste because all the hybrid healers can still wear it.  But not the other way around...

Awesome.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;1 priest is all you need per raid, for fort buff and maybe improved spirit. Paladins can heal for far longer and stack better with auras and blessings&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If you could persuade the damn Loladins to stop speccing for dps and actually heal maybe.  2 Priests / tanks (notice I say tanks and not warriors) is minimum for Karazhan imo.

Don&#039;t hate the nomes .... punt them instead, much more gratifying :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The game itself has already lost its fun, to be honest.  A lot of people I know, including myself (priest), a prot warrior, an ice mage, two enhancement shamans, a marksmanship hunter and several of the rogues have commented on the lack of fun factor, in both PvP arenas and PvE raiding.  

Not to sound like a broken record, but Death &#038; Taxes brings one holy specced priest to their raids, and the rest are shadow.  They bring generally 3+ holy paladins and a few resto druids and resto shamans to round out their 25-man Gruul kills.  Having that many priests is just not a good idea.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We currently have 57 level 70&#039;s in my guild which is just insane.

I think the only reason it has worked is our guild has been/was alot like Thingy&#039;s guild. 

It&#039;s changing though and has become rather unfun for me recently, with the only reason I am still there being I have friends there.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[All I can say is way too many priests.

1 priest is all you need per raid, for fort buff and maybe improved spirit.  Paladins can heal for far longer and stack better with auras and blessings, druids have combat rez + innervate, and shamans have bloodlust/heroism + totems for the party + grounding totems for the raid as well as shocks to interrupt.

As a priest myself, I&#039;d rather not go to the raid than go to it and feel useless like I have been feeling in Karazhan.  Oh yay shacklebot.  /shrug]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Our guild is going with the 2+ raids.  They&#039;ll be split on the day after patch day so that no two weeks have the same raiding force.  It&#039;s a real bitch, but Blizzard in their infinite wisdom decided to screw everyone over by cutting the raid numbers causing chaos for every guild that was designed on a 40-man raid.  I&#039;ve seen so many guilds on my server collapse and disband it&#039;s not funny.  Cliques everywhere.  My guild seems to be the only one not seperating to cliques.  The only reason I can see is that the first and second rule of our guild isn&#039;t &quot;Do not talk about fight club&quot; but rather &quot;Real Life &#062; WoW&quot;.

We raid hard, but have fun.  If someone can&#039;t raid or isn&#039;t able to do something else it&#039;s just a case of &quot;shit eh&quot;.  We&#039;re all friends, and that&#039;s the most important thing.  We&#039;re not here for server firsts, we&#039;re here for fun.  What we have in common is that we find raiding fun.]]></description>
