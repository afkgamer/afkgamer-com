					<description><![CDATA[Our hunter-sister is in her mid 30s, so unless she was passing herself off as a young girl to your guild, there&#039;s an epidemic and I recommend panic.

Ryan, we&#039;re full on gnomes.  :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;If that were the case my guild wouldn&#039;t eternally be looking for &#039;locks&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Here have one of mine, no actually have 4 :)

This &#039;hunter-sister&#039; sounds strangely like someone we had in our guild but left do to being harrassed after posting her pic on our legendary picture forum thread combined with myspace link.  I would say it&#039;s quite co-incidental but im sure there is something about the stereo-type of young girls going for NE female hunters (probably the nicer looking accessories, funky looking bow=handbag :P).]]></description>
