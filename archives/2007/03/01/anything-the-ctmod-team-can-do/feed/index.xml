					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Unfortunately it looks like someone over there is using this project to learn AJAX, so the site is a complete clusterfuck right now.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No shit, the page is slower than a tortoise and even on modest machines will chew up the resources.  AJAX is just horrible, combine it with another resource hog &#039;Flash&#039; to end up with the mother of all f ups of a site.

Couldn&#039;t they actually learn from DAOC&#039;s stats page?  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brokentoys.org/2007/03/01/thanks-blizzard/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Lum&lt;/a&gt; did better and over 5 years ago (as far as my brain can remember anyway).

They should just give XML feeds for guilds and characters and forget the lame AJAX attempts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I gotta hand it to them, the site looks really, really cool.  Unfortunately it looks like someone over there is using this project to learn AJAX, so the site is a complete clusterfuck right now.  

Even with all the errors, I&#039;m still refreshing my pages over and over again trying to spy on people from my server.  Definitely cool.  One of the things that CTProfiles has that the Armory doesn&#039;t is the ability to see multiple gear sets from the same person, so right now if the person logged out in their mount gear, all you get when you look at the person is riding crops and mithril spurs.  I can&#039;t wait until the performance improves, I&#039;ll probably lose my job.]]></description>
