					<description><![CDATA[I prefer to solo on my healers even though I often play games with my fiance, so I doubt it has anything to do with anything.  We both prefer soloing, as it&#039;s just more exp efficient and it&#039;s our gaming style, but we&#039;ll group together for group tasks.

In other non-news, my 70 priest is officially dead, as her account expired last week.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ya...  so, umm  what moronic guy who has his better half actually gaming with him wouldn&#039;t pass on every single item to keep her happy?

Social Darwinism is what we call that in my neighborhood.

Hell, I would run around in full Twill Armor set if it was going to be the difference between my wife quitting WOW or me getting my next piece of loot.]]></description>

 It may suck sometimes that drama is created but if couples didn&#039;t play together then I think half the priest and druid population would dissappear overnight.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ran my wife&#039;s gnome warrior through Gnomeregan the other day.  She&#039;s level 28 and she just wanted to get that instance out of the way, pugless.

Anyway, the Supercharged Battleaxe drops.

I tell her &quot;Nice axe.  But you&#039;re almost 30, it&#039;s only level 24, and we&#039;ll get you your Warrior class Whirlwind Axe in just 2 more levels.  So please just send it to Sparky, my Draenei Shaman, who&#039;s only level 18 now.&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; she says.  &quot;Cool,&quot; I think.

Next day I get home.  She&#039;s on her Gnome, turning in quests, and ain&#039;t it the damndest thing, she&#039;s got that axe equipped.

&quot;Hey.  Isn&#039;t that the axe you&#039;re supposed to mail to my Draenei?&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;

I can say, from experience, that if you going to play with your significant other, do NOT, under any circumstances, play the same class! I mean, WTF is wrong with this guy (assuming it&#039;s true)? My wife and I play together and we try to make it a point to not even play classes with the same armor type.

But I do remember the time she totally hosed me on the Staff of Dominance back in the day. =)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lrn2DKP, nub. 

Love you. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;I&#039;ve learned that I enjoy it best when I quit playing each play session at a peak. If I play until I&#039;m sick of it ... I play too much and it leaves a sour taste in my mouth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

why? there&#039;s nothing more frustrating to the other 4/9/24 ppl who have to replace you in the middle of the raid because you left right as everything was the most fun. stick it out until the end and make it up by raiding less often, imo.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I guess I should be thankful my guild put me off my priests before Blizz could do it then, eh :p The guild was IRL friends and nonfriends and all the complications that it brought along. Yeuch.

My SO played very casually up until recently when I left the guild with all his friends in, now he&#039;s pretty much lost interest which I think will make him more sensitive to the amount of time I spend playing... but currently we&#039;re doing the long distance thing anyway. If/when it comes to it, all he has to do is say the word: he is definately my priority.]]></description>
