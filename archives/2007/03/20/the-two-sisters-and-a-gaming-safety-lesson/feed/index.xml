					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I won&#039;t even mention anywhere online that my husband is going out of town until he&#039;s back and home again. That&#039;s Common Sense 101--don&#039;t tell people how to find you, where you&#039;ll be when, and so on.

And wow, &quot;perfect man&quot;--well, she&#039;s gonna be looking for a loooong time. And what&#039;s the fun in a perfect man anyway?

I forget to stop by for just a few days and I miss ALL the good stories!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Back in the glory days of DAoC I was on a very close-knit server.  Someone created a post-your-RL-pic webpage and got an enormous response from our server community.  It wasn&#039;t nearly as closely knit.  Let me envision my guild full of really cool people... guys who you wouldn&#039;t mind hanging out with at the bar.   Please don&#039;t let me see your rotten teeth and your huge beer belly while you pose in front a mirror holding a 9mm Beretta you borrowed from your little brother, the wannabe cop working as a security guard.  The people I&#039;ve noticed who are most eager to post their pictures are either so ugly that they&#039;ve heard it all before an don&#039;t care, or are folks who have barely above-average looks and have a &#039;my milshake is better than yours&#039; attitude.  Me?  I know I&#039;m cooler and better looking than everyone.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The first part was enough to bring me to tears.  I couldn&#039;t tell how much was truth or embellishment for the laughs.  I mean, these people can&#039;t do anything to you in real life and is the guild drama that compelling that you keep tabs on the ex Emoes?  LOL If so, the rest of us are missing really good fun.  I have nothing but real life Emoes and they&#039;re not as entertaining. :-)

By the time I got to the sisters and the MySpace I was in stitches laughing.  I hate MySpace and people with &quot;serious&quot; profiles on there scare me.  Did you visit the Blizzard MySpace when it was first launched? I saw peeps that would make me piss myself if I ran across them in an alley.

We all have our issues, but I don&#039;t want to know that you&#039;re really a nutcase in real life.  Know what I&#039;m saying?  It removes me giving people&#039;s online behavior the benefit of the doubt. =)]]></description>
