					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;It&#039;s quite a bad trend actually, I had a friend convert from a non-jumpy paladin to a NE rogue and now he constantly jumps as well as me :P&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shhhh. itsnay on the lolodin-nay!

I know why rogues are jumping - no buffs to give. We poison up and that&#039;s it - just wait for the others with their buffs and their mana. So in between complaining about wanting might AND kings, (&quot;sticksalvationwherethesundontshineicanvanish&quot;) one has to amuse one&#039;s self - and seeing how many times out of ten your NElf does a tumble rather than a straight jump, then putting the results into a chart in Excel, hmm, I might be the only one to do that, eh?

					<description><![CDATA[They forgot one:

 The tank  starts telling the priest that he&#039;s healing incorrectly, the mage he&#039;s nuking incorrectly and that by God the rogue used the wrong opening move, all this in the middle of the first pull.  Usually right after he&#039;s managed to hit the sheeped mob and the sapped mob with his Thunder Clap]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;

In no way am I exempt from jumping up and down incessantly. We all have a little PUG noobishness in us whether we like it or not.

Plus.. rogues are ADD
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I constantly jump to amuse myself out of sheer bordem that are PUG groups.  When I get in a guild only group .. I still jump because, shit I dunno why I just do.  I&#039;m neither 12 year old rogue-stereotype or have ADD it&#039;s just something else to do.  Mabbe Rogues lack buttons to press all the time and never have anything to do they amuse themselves.

It&#039;s quite a bad trend actually, I had a friend convert from a non-jumpy paladin to a NE rogue and now he constantly jumps as well as me :P

As for when the group is formed and someone afk&#039;s ... well I have more trouble with guild groups like that, pre-TBC I never really had to 5/10 man with my guild much as most of us formed around teir1 era so my only experiance was leading the rabble, and our main emo-tank (thanks for the phrase btw)  used to randomly AFK, usually when there was nasty trash to be cleared (you know pre-patch or pre faerlina boring long pulls) but more recently he&#039;s been 5 manning with me and he &#039;still&#039; insists on random afk without a word.  If he wasn&#039;t an officer I would have chucked his afk-ass outta the guild a long time ago.]]></description>
