					<description><![CDATA[Interesting.  Very interesting.

And indeed, FoH results are blank, as of 8 pm PST tonight. 
http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/#guild-info.xml?r=Black%20Dragonflight&amp;n=Fires%20of%20Heaven&amp;p=1
In contrast, my guild results are fully visible and functional as of the same time.  

Individual FoH members are visible (what few names I know), but not a guild listing/roster.  Crazy.

Maybe they&#039;re (Blizz) testing an opt-out system?

UPDATE:  3/9/07 the FoH listing has been restored!  I&#039;ll bet they&#039;re relieved.  WoW Forum discussion &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=81880446&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=16&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, with blue (Blizz) response.  And it&#039;s interesting that after all these years how incredibly popular Furor is with the EQ crowd.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I second Random Poster, there&#039;s &lt;strike&gt;nothing&lt;/strike&gt; only a few things wrong with the current system. One is you cannot search for any dungeon. I have the same issues with the new meeting stones, it&#039;s stupid that you cannot summon any level to the stones. Perhaps put a bottom cap, but not an upper level cap. In then end, I simply think people are too lazy to use it.

There are simply far to many things wrong with Warcraft to keep me playing.  I am staying around until my current 3-month subscription runs out, then I&#039;m uninstalling the game. I actually think the expansion caused a lot more problems than it fixed, as we&#039;re seeing by the continual nerf of items and classes. On my 2-year anniversary of WoW, I&#039;ll be finished due to this new, idiotic dev team. Way to go, Blizzard.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is nothing wrong with the current LFG tool if people USED it.

The reason it sucks is no one uses the damn thing, so when people go LFG in it they go oh well hell no one is in here..let&#039;s spam chat and leaves.]]></description>
