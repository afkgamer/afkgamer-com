<p>Yep. When we software developers compare software versions in code, at least in C-like languages it&#8217;s usually in a structure with each element represented separately. So we never compare the entire version &#8220;number&#8221;, it&#8217;s always in pieces, where it makes sense that 2.0.2 is earlier (less than) 2.0.10.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Increasing rage generation sends a signal that all the dps warriors really are playing the way they should, they were just over nerfed and now that it&#8217;s fixed they can forget about going into protection.</p>
<p>For groups to work 1 in every 5 characters needs to be a tank.  Are even 1 in 5 warriors protection specced?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I was fine with bear tanks &#8211; hell, buff rogues and warlocks to let them main tank, and let mages solo heal a 5-man, it will just make it a lot more likely that I&#8217;ll actually get to run an instance when I log on tonight instead of being frustrated by the fact that we have a class balance based around a 40-man paradigm which means many of us really need to reroll.</p>

<p>Its the sound of millions of mages removing Ice Lance from their hotkeys. &#8221;</p>
<p>Now the mages know how the priests felt when news came that POM was going to be nerfed.  Not that I&#8217;m thinking &#8220;serves you right for laughing at me about my nerf.&#8221;  If anything, it&#8217;s just more depressing. </p>
<p>As the priests have pointed out, BC came out dangling these promising carrots to upgrade all classes, and a few patches later Blizzard is undoing them all and taking away the carrots &#8212; but only from some classes.  Other classes get to keep theirs.</p>
<p>But how long until they start taking them all away one by one?</p>

<p>The problem with leading zeroes is that you simply can&#8217;t predict if you&#8217;ll need them or not, or how many.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re example of 2.0.02 doesn&#8217;t take into account 2.10.01 which would be the first patch of the 10th minor release of the second major release&#8230; and what if, God forbid, you had more than 99 patches to a single minor release&#8230;   leading zeroes just cause more trouble than they are worth.  🙂</p>

<p>I like the smaller raid parties ALOT, but it&#8217;s a juggle to get a suitable mix when there&#8217;s only 10 or 25 slots to fill.  Not inviting rogues has worked well for us, however.  (I kid!)</p>

<p>Hah, well it does work rather well for both classes 😛</p>
<p>Although with all the druids going Bear, and  alot of the paladins not specced for healing I still much preferred a Healing specced priest.</p>

<p>It works so well when a single holy paladin constitute almost as much healing on the healing meters as two holy/disc priests <strong>combined</strong>.  That&#8217;s right, all three healers similarly geared, all raid specced and buffed, and yet the holy paladin has far more longetivity and mana efficiency to outlast both priests.  I had a dream about this last month and forgot about it until I started reading over my gripes before this POM nerf even appeared on the horizon.  Now I&#8217;m just bitter as all hell.</p>
<p>When I can find a game that doesn&#8217;t inspire competition among <em>support </em>classes to see who supports better (e.g. priest racial spells like fear ward), constantly nerfs support spells and makes some classes clearly superior support classes in all aspects of the game (for instances, world pvp, raiding, arenas &#8212; paladin is clearly <em>the </em>#1 support class)&#8230; I&#8217;m going there and I&#8217;m never looking back at this POS called WOW.</p>

<p>Which I think might have been a driving force behind the Druid nerfing. Druids will most likely still be fine tanks in the 5mans (god I hope so..hated waiting 40+mins for a warrior to join a 5man run).</p>
<p>I am curious how my guild is going to handle it, absolutely none of our warriors have even mentioned returning to Prot spec, hell not even sure the lazy bastards have read the patch notes.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Most of my guilds warriors don&#8217;t even seem to be playing much these days, I have to scream and stomp my feet to get them in a raid, and even then they are Dps specced.  We relied heavily on Bear tanks in Karazhan (1war 1 bear) to get us through and the fact that bears were better tanks for some fights and warriors others.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard enough with some part timers getting a decent Karazhan group started and carrying on through the week let alone with the Druids now not really wanting to play much either.  Apathy for TBC raiding has reached it&#8217;s peak, where as in Naxx/Bwl days I&#8217;d have 10 or 12 people left over wanting to get in the raid and spamming every 5 mins if there was a spot.</p>
<p>So much for making raiding more guild friendly, as far as I can see it&#8217;s pretty much made people not really care about it.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Druids were hotfixed last night, raising the threat Mangle(Bear) generates to almost as much as it did pre-2.0.10.<br />
Also, Lacerate now deals a small amount of damage(and by small I mean 20-40 critting 60 or so at level 70) allowing it to have some kind of effect on bleed-immune mobs.</p>
<p>Perhaps this makes druids viable tanks again?</p>
