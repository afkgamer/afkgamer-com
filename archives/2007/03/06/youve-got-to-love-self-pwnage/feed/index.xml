					<description><![CDATA[This is why I don&#039;t publicize my math musings.  I only make silly bets with my guy about whether pico or nano is a smaller measurement unit.

I lost, though. Pico turned out to be smaller than nano. :/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, that definitely hurt my brain a bit.

Like others, I had to reread the post a couple times to actually believe someone could be that dumb. And then when I read the reply to the effect of &quot;You just made yourself look like a total retard. Congrats.&quot;, I saw what you meant about making sure I wasn&#039;t drinking something.

The whole scenario keeps playing itself over and over in my head, and each time it just gets more amusing and more sad, lol.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I saw the math post and just... read it three or four times, thinking, I CAN&#039;T have just read this. But it was still there, even after all the blinking and turning the laptop screen sideways and all that.

I&#039;d like to think the person just totally forgot to drink their coffee that morning and can&#039;t think until after they&#039;ve had three or four tall cups of the stuff. But that seems overly optimistic.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;I guess you failed that part of the math test.

x &lt; y = X is GREATER then Y

x &gt; y = X is LESS then y

Your title is saying &quot;Karazhan loot is GREATER then blues. anouther big wtf?&quot; that doesn&#039;t make any sense.&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I suppose you mean the math post :)
But I also thought this was insightful: &quot; I believe those blue shoulders are getting nerfed next patch. It&#039;s Blizzard&#039;s way of improving Karazhan loot.&quot;
lol :)]]></description>
