					<description><![CDATA[Welp, I have already leveled 9 characters to 60 about two months &lt;strong&gt;BEFORE&lt;/strong&gt; patch 2.3 hit. Heh. My levels currently : 

70 70 70 66 63 62 61 61 61

Althras, Beltek, Ordanil, Xastar, Mizar, Xalastar, Xiona, Swaard, Lenick - all on Suramar US server.

I guess I lose out on the speeded up leveling thing eh? I fully intend to have 9 70s before WotLK. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Daeric

If you have had Kara on farm for some time (and you are mostly if not fully Kara equipped) then there&#039;s a good chance you&#039;ll at least get bear and eagle down.  I would suspect that most guilds farming Kara should have 3-4 bosses farmed by Christmas.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[wowpanda: I&#039;m in the middle of leveling a mid 20&#039;s pally, and I can assure you that despite all the hype, there are quite a few low level quests that didn&#039;t get dumbed down. 

Generally, ones with multiple elite mobs (Dun Mordor) for example are now all non elite, but single targets (like Mord&#039;lam) are all still elite and bitchy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[chicogrande, I am still in a bad shape.  Because I don&#039;t that much time to play, so my gears are all +heal and +dmg to make sure I can play solo.  I will check my toon again to make sure.

And this is to Dearic.  Agreed.  I am still far from heroic stuff, just regular stuff is giving me enough headaches.  Good thing Blizzard is making the pre 60 quests solo able.  They should do the same to TBC.  So far dungeon runs has been huge money sinks for me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So where does ZA fit on the difficulty scale?

I assume it&#039;s harder than Kara, but is it now the &quot;next&quot; raid instance you take your 10 man raid to after Kara, or do you have to bulk up to 25 raiders to get the gear to survive in the new 10 man raid?

I&#039;m not sure how I feel about the Heroic key requirements honestly.  Sure it makes it a lot easier to get geared up from the position I&#039;m in....   But it&#039;s also likely to encourage many people to do Heroic dungeons who are just not ready for them.    Leading to an overall downgrading of the experience from a few wipes per run to a wipe every 5 minutes.    Like yesterday, when some idiot thought the solution to the tank shortage we were experiencing was to bring in a fury / arms warrior with 9k hp to be our tank.  (My connection got extremely unstable all of the sudden when the idiot shaman announced that.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@wowpanda

From the patch notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Healing: Almost all items and enchantments that provide bonus healing now also provide a smaller number (approximately 1/3) of bonus spell damage. There are a few items and enchantments where this was not possible, such as random-stat items and Zul&#039;Gurub enchantments, but this is now the case on virtually all other items.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In my case, my priest has about 1830 +healing, which is currently translating to around 698ish spell dmg, without the need to don a patchwork set of dps gear. Smite baby, smite.]]></description>
