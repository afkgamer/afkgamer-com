					<description><![CDATA[No no, the vanish problem is you DO vanish, then due to the time it takes your machine to tell the server you did vanish, one of the mobs&#039;s last hits on you doesnt come back to you and hit you til AFTER you vanish, thus bringing you out of stealth again. It&#039;s not even an instantaneous thing, usually there&#039;s a few seconds to take a few steps running away, but no, the mob is there to kill your joy (and you).

Not 100% on the specifics only the fact it is very irritating. Especially when you manage to use preparation and vanish again before you die, only for them to take you out of it again.

As for the &#039;you lag, you die&#039; aspect, of course that&#039;s expected when you have VERY BAD LAG, but this happens even with minimal latency.

Does no one else get pissed off with this?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;it&#039;s not that big a deal. &#039;you lag, you die&#039; is pretty standard in MMOs across the board.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of my favorite EVE features is this: When my internet connection dies or client crashes in the middle of a mission, the program warps me out of the mission deadspace I&#039;m in and doesn&#039;t warp me back until I reconnect. That way I&#039;m much less likely to get killed by the dropped connection.

In lotro, if I lag while running, I just stay where I am and pick up there when the lag dies off. Which  means that lag doesn&#039;t cause me to run into the middle of a bunch of mobs. In Warcraft, lag always causes me to run god-knows-where, usually off of a cliff or into elite mobs.

Sure, there isn&#039;t much they can do in general about lag effects, but there are some ways in which they could have a better failure mode.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[re: Gemma

i check what my latency is up to with /stealth all the time, and depending on the lagginess, i change my playstyle accordingly. 

it&#039;s not that big a deal. &quot;you lag, you die&quot; is pretty standard in MMOs across the board. 

in the case of vanish, what&#039;s the problem? you push the vanish button and you don&#039;t vanish immediately due to latency? ok, how is blizzard going to fix that? maybe they could employ an &quot;ai vanish&quot; that interprets for you when you SHOULD vanish and then preemptively does so. since presumably all the other button-pushing is affected by latency also, the new rogue AI could just take care of those as well until the player&#039;s only real job would be to point and steer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We got fear ward? Maybe I should actually read the notes o_O sounds like its a big thing :p.

Nice sites, personally never come across them before, perused them a bit and came to a certain paragraph that makes me a sad panda having just got my rogue to 70:

Some of the things we have commented on before, especially in regards to Vanish. Vanish isn&#039;t bugged and it is in fact working as intended, however it is affected by latency, which is what people perceives as being bugged. There are currently no plans for changing the way that Vanish works, which I most certainly know that you don&#039;t want to hear. However that does not mean that the developers will dismiss these concerns, because if they find a proper way to address this issue, then such a solution will be implemented.


So basically, you lag, you die, you work as intended? GG thanks :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wonder if Foton has young children? I&#039;d say 85% of my DVR contains said blue dog and interchangeable baby-faced male green-screen actors. Sigh. Here&#039;s the mail it never fails..

WoWBlues looks like a sexier version of http://blue.cardplace.com/ which I&#039;ve been using for awhile.

I honestly don&#039;t understand how Blizzard expects the average, schmoe WoW gamer to read 5 pages of patch notes. I end up reading the whole thing, and extracting the nuggets that pertain to my class in Notepad. Do the run of the mill, casual players really read all this stuff? I mean, are all the priests out there really going to know they all have fear ward now? C&#039;mon.]]></description>
