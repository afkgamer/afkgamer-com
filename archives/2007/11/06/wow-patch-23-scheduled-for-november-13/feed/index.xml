					<description><![CDATA[I kinda agree, I for one spent two months farming 5K gold for my flyer and have to listen to everyone bitch about how expensive it is all the time.  My reply....FARM IT.....like we all did.....lol.

As far as S1 glad gear for honor though I agree with that, especially since they&#039;re making the more desirable S3 pieces rating dependant, and there is almost no way for me to catch up with elite arena ppl as their gear will now be that much better (AGAIN) than mine. Arena points come too slowly to begin with. Also, the S1 glad staff or spellblade will really help me, since I&#039;ve been running Kara like every night for THREE MONTHS and no Staff of Infinite Mysteries or Mindblade lol.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think yu misread what the guy meant. He spent insane amount of time to get 5000G and his arena season 2 gear while all the peasants now can get it with little sweat and no skillz.

Welfare epic for the win! Yeah wow is getting so cheap so fast that you better wait a little while to get anything instead of raiding or doing anything else that takes too much time.

This is terrible for hardcore who quit the game and when they quit, many will follow because the game will become boring for all. Easy rewards is never a good answer to anything!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, that&#039;s a huge improvement for skilling up leatherworking, then.  I don&#039;t regret having maxxed it, the dragonscale stuff is nice for my hunter; but when/if I finish leveling my old hunter, I&#039;ll be ecstatic not to be grinding clefthoof/paying for primal earths.

On the bonus side, the boots I made skilling up got me crystals to put enchants on weapons.]]></description>
