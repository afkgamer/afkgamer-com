					<description><![CDATA[Curt Schilling is one of the biggest attention whores this planet has ever known. And, yeah, he knows how to pretend to be a nice guy, but that&#039;s for the rep.

					<description><![CDATA[I got to play with Curt in Everquest on the Povar.  He&#039;s actually a really down to earth and very nice guy.  

This is probably one of the funniest interviews I&#039;ve ever read.

Because dear god, every time he logs in now he&#039;s going to be INUNDATED with whispers.]]></description>
