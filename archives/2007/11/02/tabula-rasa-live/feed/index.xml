					<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;All MMOS are going to be the same people. No one can throw the book out and re write the script on how an MMO should be. You have to go for what will sell and bring in the return on investment.&lt;/i&gt;

Actually, a lot of folks above were saying they didn&#039;t mind similarity between MMOs, they just minded being fed a bunch of hype saying the MMO would be wildly different when it was just going to be similar.

I used to see the same thing with tabletop games when I followed them. An okay game that was similar to others and probably would have done fine on those merits would end up getting trashed and forgotten because they&#039;d spend months before release hyping how &quot;revolutionary&quot; their gameplay was... where if they&#039;d just said &quot;hey, we&#039;ve made some cool changes to the games you&#039;re used to&quot; people would have been okay with that.

It&#039;s one thing to try to build hype, it&#039;s another to build hype by lying. No one likes being lied to.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I bought and installed TR. Paid for one month. 
I am personally liking the game. Hard to get used to the UI though, at first. Mostly attributed to being used to the WOW ui. 
Game play is cool. Very fast paced. I do enjoy the feeling you get of being involved in an actual combat zone. 
I&#039;m 2nd tier right now doing the quests in Wilderness (had a hard time getting used to multiple instanced maps). Great graphics and scenery, they did a good job on that part of the game.  
The game is not without its bugs though. There are places where you can wall walk, Kill mobs without them attacking you, and some quests are bugged as well. 

overall I give it a 9 out of 10. 

All MMOS are going to be the same people. No one can throw the book out and re write the script on how an MMO should be. You have to go for what will sell and bring in the return on investment. 

Awaiting the arrival of Hell Gate.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[HGL is very much Diablo (or Roguelike if you prefer) with FPS controls and sensabilities.  There&#039;s melee, but it controls somewhat like Oblivion minus the manual shielding.  So again, FPS controls.  In my opinion, the movement and manipulation of characters makes it really hard to go back to overhead point/click A-RPGs.  Very hard.  HGL is just much more interactive, and thereby more enticing.  

It&#039;s not without faults, namely bad chat interface, repetitive scenery (makes sense since we&#039;re in a demon-overrun London I suppose), and horrid inventory management.  But despite these faults, I&#039;m absolutely loving it.  Check my site for videos, etc.

It&#039;s free online, but no additional content to non-subscribers, and 10 a month for those who want special events and the every-few-months new areas/quests/etc.  

TR, I was in since Alpha.  Extreme-Alpha as they called it.  Try though I did, I never enjoyed it.  it was always just more of the same diguised not to be.  Great idea, but overall an underwhelming execution.

15 bucks a month?  No.  Free or pay by the hour?  Maybe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I somehow missed Diablo back in the day, so I think of Hellgate as more like Wolfenstein meets City of Heroes meets 28 Days Later...minus some of the storyline. If there&#039;s single player mode and cutscenes, I haven&#039;t found them. But it&#039;s still a blast. Amongst other things...shooting your guns separately on left and right mouseclick is awesome, in a stupidfun kinda way.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, nothing about the beta could draw me back in.  I leveled to second teir and then never went back.  The combat was awkward at best and the interface and npc interanction was cumbersome.

I like the new header, foton :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I played for a few weeks in beta.

There&#039;s nothing particularly wrong with the game, and I enjoyed the time I spent.  But the &#039;blank slate&#039; thing is pure marketing hype.  This game is 1) sci fi, 2) roughly fps based, and everything else is exactly like every other MMO you&#039;ve played.  I was really disappointed, since I was looking for innovation, which I don&#039;t define as the same class archtypes (now with guns!) in a level system based around gaining experience points from killing mobs and completing quests.  What, kill 10 foozles, so I can gain a level and gain more skill points and use a weapon that does X+10 damage?

Now I make a point of not flaming games just for using a tried and true system that I honestly enjoy for the most part.  If you want to iterate on the latest MMO&#039;s, that&#039;s fine, but don&#039;t make me swallow months of marketing about how you threw away the book on making MMO and then produce this crap.  Just today I&#039;m reading more British quotes about how WoW just copied EQ and that&#039;s why Tabula Rasa is so awesome.  Honestly TB is more like WoW than WoW is like EQ, and TB is even more like LOTRO.  

I&#039;d consider playing Tabula Rasa if it were free.  But honestly I might not.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just picked up a copy of Tabula Rasa and have about 1 hr of gameplay so far, but I&#039;m liking it a lot so far.  The movement is a bit awkward, but the fighting is great.  No more just standing there clicking on buttons.  Its sorta like GTA, but with a lot more fighting options.  Still haven&#039;t really gotten into it enough to give a full opition, but so far im liking what Im seeing.]]></description>
