					<description><![CDATA[Best source of names to annoy people like you: &quot;Bored of the Rings&quot; by the Harvard Lampoon. (Examples: Frito and Dildo Bugger, Tom Benzadrine) It&#039;s quite a funny book in it&#039;s own right, and a brilliant parody of the Trilogy.

					<description><![CDATA[Not even close. The worst name by far is from someone that does not even know what game it is playing.  I am talking about the name &quot;Prretygirl&quot;.  I am sure that it was playing virtual barbie just moments before.  The name is so bad that I can&#039;t even hazard a guess at the gender of the person playing, so it will be known as it. It has created the worst name ever.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It was always the easiest part for me to make up any unique character name that fits into the lore. and LOTRO in particular gives some nice tips how race-specific names are being built.
And for the creativity impaired, there&#039;s plenty of name generators throughout the intarweb. Like this: http://www.chriswetherell.com/elf/ or that: http://www.chriswetherell.com/hobbit/ or one might just google for &quot; name generator&quot;.

Everytime I see a &quot;Legollass&quot; or &quot;Paladin658&quot; it fills me with utter disgust for those poor creatures that choose to expose themselves to the world bearing such pitiful names.

And no, I won&#039;t reveal my favourite in-game names as you will most likely steal it :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bah.
When I first knew my bf his nick was Legolas. This however, was way WAY before all the LOTR hype, back in the days of actually reading the books etc. Dare I say it... back when it was cool? :s

I always fancied Duplolas as a take on it, but now, that would be torn apart like any other -olas like you said.]]></description>
