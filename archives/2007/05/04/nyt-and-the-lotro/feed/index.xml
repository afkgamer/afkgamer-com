					<description><![CDATA[&quot;I just think LOTR has no soul.&quot;

Yes, and going to instances over and over to possibly get some random drop is very good for the soul. I am in no way inexperienced in WoW. About half a dozen high level chars on 3 diff servers. I just cant go back now. LOTRO is the next gen, Turbine did well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just think LOTR has no soul. It&#039;s vaguely fun, but it has no emotion. WoW may be a grind but it also has buckets of character. And, as much as I love the Tolkien lore (hell, I went to the same college as Tolkien and it&#039;s actually in the location that gave him the idea for The Two Towers), the lack of magic in a fantasy MMORPG just hurts it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rick,

I&#039;d say that depending on when you played the beta, you may be out to lunch on that. I played beta in December and then did the pre-order thing. A lot had changed in the intervening four months. All those post-quest fun-rating quizzes seem to have been taken to heart. My longer take is &lt;a href=&quot;http://rabidpaladin.com/archive/2007/05/01/lord-of-the-rings-online---a-review.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; if you want my opinion in detail, though.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dunno, I&#039;m both a fan of the Tolkien world and interested in &quot;the future of online entertainment&quot;, but the LOTRO beta left me flat. It was fun to run around in Middle Earth for a little bit, but the game wasn&#039;t very much fun and it didn&#039;t compel me to buy the game at release. It might just be me, I see a lot of other bloggers I respect enjoying the game, but I don&#039;t see the appeal outside of the quick Middle Earth costume party. If I had to guess, I&#039;d say once the shine is off the novelty of running around Middle Earth, people will start to get bored with the actual game. I&#039;m prepared to be wrong though...maybe I&#039;m just old and a curmudgeon and I&#039;m missing something fabulous.]]></description>
