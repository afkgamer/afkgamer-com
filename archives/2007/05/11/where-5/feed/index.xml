					<description><![CDATA[Wow. Just read the Tseric link. That guy doesn&#039;t need a vacation--he needs a new job. Yeah, the community reps have it bad, and there&#039;s no way they get paid enough to take that kind of crud. But if you get to the point he has, it&#039;s time to just walk away, not wallow in it.

And while he does make some good points, I couldn&#039;t help noting this one: &quot;an uncrafted and improvisational campaign of misery and spin-doctoring&quot;

Umm, isn&#039;t that kind of contradictory? Either it&#039;s a campaign, or it&#039;s &#039;uncrafted and improvisational.&#039; It can&#039;t really be both. He soooo needs to find a new job before he cracks the rest of the way. Hopefully it&#039;ll be something relaxing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Anon - WoW (pun!)  That guy needs a vacation.

Keystone - was a happy coincidence that I picked two water shots, showing how each game handles water differently.   (I&#039;m NOT saying WoW is bad, just different.)

Anyways, WoW = Zul&#039;Aman in the Ghostlands as a few people said.

LOTRO = Nen Harn, far northeastern Breeland, looking towards Nan Wathren in North Downs.]]></description>
