					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Blizz likes to nerf and balance the classes based on PvP&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#039;ve always felt that there should be separate stats for equipment/skills depending on if one is flagged for PvP or not flagged.

That however brings up the issue of PvP realms and I promptly run face first in to a brick wall.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[All this retuning instances to compensate for the alchemy/elixir usage nerfs is interesting.

I wonder when they&#039;ll start retuning their instancing for NO HEALING cos all the healers are fucking extinct.

Btw anyone know when this patch hits europe? I don&#039;t really pay attention to such things, I like surprises.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Blizz likes to nerf and balance the classes based on PvP, regardless of what it does to PvE, and have made classes nearly unbearable for long periods of time (has a holy priest ever been fun?).  They&#039;re also prone to the old SOE PvE nerf system (Make it more difficult after the first guilds in have farmed the hell out of it and complain it&#039;s too easy).  I have yet to miss Warcraft in any shape or form in the weeks since I&#039;ve quit playing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This kind of insane changes are why I left WoW.  Blizzard is too new on the MMO scene and it shows in how they constantly rebalance the game.  The same Warlock I played in beta is nothing close to the Warlock of today and it even changed 12 times in between those periods.  They need to find a balance and stick to it.  The game gets to inconsistent and then instead of loving the game people are constantly hating X change or Y nerf each month.

Concerning the Warlock thing... the funny thing is that Warlock in Beta went from insanely overpowered badasses to the weakest class in the game and then back to pretty damn good.  So what was the point to all of that?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Speaking as someone who no longer plays a healing class (well, feral Druid and elemental Shaman, but I&#039;ll be respecing resto on either one when hell freezes over):

Thanks for nerfing Paladin healing and giving marginal upgrades to highly situational talents for the 10% of Priests who are still crazy enough to spec Holy.   I really appreciate the chance to spend an extra hour looking for a healer for every goddamn group.

Seriously, WTF.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not clear how much the mining change will mean.

I did my standard mining loop through Zangarmarsh, Blade&#039;s Edge and Netherstorm on the PRT and I didn&#039;t see a significant change in mob placing or behavior. Some changes, but no big deal.

Of course, the effects at lvl 70 are minimized, but I still don&#039;t think it&#039;s as big a change as some folks are expecting.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Were I still playing this game, I would love the 23 hour alchemy cooldown.  Unless you are capable of dropping whatever you are doing and having your alchemist logged in the second your cooldown is up, you suffer from a big case of timer creep.  Your 8 pm xmute becomes an 815 xmute, which is after 11 in less than a week, and eventually you miss a day because you simply have to go to bed.  Then it starts over again.]]></description>
