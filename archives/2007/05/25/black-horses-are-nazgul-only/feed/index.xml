					<description><![CDATA[From Chris:  &quot;Im at level 20 now and about to hit the 1 gold mark &quot;

You&#039;re ripe for the 1 gold buyout scam in the Auction House. Unscrupulous vendors will put a few hides up for sale for a small bid with a buyout of 1g 4s 20c, hoping you will jump at the seemingly low buyout without noticing the 1g kicker. If you have a gold then the buyout works, and you have no recourse.

Hope Turbine adds an optional buyout confirmation window to the AH.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good to know. Every time to go off to farm I seem to pick heavily quested areas. I&#039;m at level 20 now and about to hit the 1 gold mark so I won&#039;t sweat it too much. Unfortunately I&#039;m apparently more skilled at dying than you are apparently. I&#039;ll have to work out the difference there.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was a cheap bastard until lvl 35, didn&#039;t die in instances a whole ton (i.e. huge repair bills), didn&#039;t buy or sell anything on the AH (i.e. lazy) and I was at about 3 gold, 800 silver when I dinged 35.  I spent an hour killing orcs and gobs for a deed and did a couple solo quests to get the rest of the cash.

If I was smarter, I would have had the cash right away, but was easy enough to farm the rest.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m estimating about a month before I&#039;m 35. How difficult did you find it to make the money needed for your mount? I&#039;m miserly in the Auction House and a gatherer, but I&#039;m trying to decide whether or not to do a bit of side farming to make sure I&#039;ve got the cash when mount time comes.]]></description>
