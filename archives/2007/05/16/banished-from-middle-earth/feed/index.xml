					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Right so the review of your ban is also an automated process? That in itself is pretty ridiculous.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Um, no. All that means is that the message is automated. It&#039;s common practice for Customer Support teams, as it helps save time and therefore money. The responses you get are either pre-written and chosen by a human or pre-written and automatically sent by the machine after a particular action has been taken by a human.

In this case, the pre-written response indicates that a ban won&#039;t be reviewed as it has already been reviewed before being implemented. All Patience was saying is that the message was, at least in this case, wrong. Take a look at some other games sometime ... Guild Wars has had it&#039;s fair share of incorrect bans over the last year or so. Their message also states that no review will be undertaken, as that review has already been done. However, they&#039;ve had numerous bans overturned after players requested a review.

What&#039;s happened with LotRO here has happened before in other games and will happen again in future with other games. It&#039;s not easy for the companies. They need to clean out as many of the illegitimate players as possible (because the players insist on it), but then when mistakes are made in the process they get hit by the very same players.

They&#039;ll fine-tune their system and I&#039;m sure in future these complaints will come in one at a time instead of en masse as it did here (again, GW is a good example - their first large scale ban resulted in something like 250ish false bans that were overturned, since then they get maybe 1 or 2 every couple of months).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My favourite bit about this whole thing is this line in Patience&#039;s &quot;customer service&quot; thread...
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the meantime I encourage those whose accounts were banned to again contact customer service, even if they received an email saying their situation had been reviewed and the ban upheld, as apparently it&#039;s an &lt;strong&gt;automated message &lt;/strong&gt;and the bans actually are eligible for appeal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Right so the review of your ban is also an automated process? That in itself is pretty ridiculous.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#039;Course what really gets me (having read even further) are all the &quot;OMG fire someone!&quot; posts. Uh, mistakes happen, guys. Don&#039;t think when you all hit the real world you&#039;ll want to be fired for every little screwup. And yeah, this definitely sounds like some sort of automated script screwup.

So I hope they&#039;ve disabled it, &#039;cause I play a lot, and I&#039;d hate to trigger it...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Normally I&#039;d figure it&#039;s probably a few players not wanting to admit the real reasons why they&#039;re getting banned. However, there do seem to be some common threads that kind of make sense here. If I had to guess, their scripts for picking out people who might be sharing accounts, using macros, or power-leveling take into account the amount of time you spend online in some manner, and are giving that too much weight, so that it&#039;s catching folks who are on vacation, jobless, or otherwise spending a ton of time online.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah... and that&#039;s why this game has such a good Customer Service rating on mmorpg.com.  I&#039;ve been pretty delighted by the customer service for this game.  This is likely not much more than some idiot GM screwing stuff up more than actual policy of Turbine.  Turbine is not new to MMOs.  They&#039;ve never done anything like this in their past MMOs and I can&#039;t see them doing it now.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Would be funny if they had to ban someone on a $200 dollar life-plan.

It smells fishy to me since everyone always claims they are innocent and I&#039;m naturally cynical about that. However MMO companies don&#039;t help themselves by sending out such bland and uninformative emails as shown in that thread. I mean, one sentence in a short email with 5 different possible reasons for the banning, that&#039;s just lazy. Then needing your community manager to post that despite the clear warning that you cannot appeal, you should actually do so, that&#039;s just LOL.]]></description>
