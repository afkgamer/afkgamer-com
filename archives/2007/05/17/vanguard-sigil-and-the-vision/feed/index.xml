					<description><![CDATA[This is no longer entertaining when people are getting fired and losing their jobs... while the (former) boss is still a millionaire.  Most of the day-to-day workers didn&#039;t really deserve this.

On a slightly unrelated note, I really really really really really (plus a few more really&#039;s) hate Tseric&#039;s condescending and downright nasty attitude toward the customers on the Blizzard forums.  So,  I&#039;m glad he&#039;s gone, or fired, or off to pursue other things, or whatever.  He never should have been a community manager in the first place.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;f13.net: For everyone involved, do you have a Google Alert on &quot;The Vision?&quot;

Brad McQuaid: Hm. No. I have it on McQuaid and Sigil I think. I should probably put one on &quot;The Hub of All Blame&quot; as well.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I laughed really hard ... not at Brad&#039;s &#039;quip&#039; either :)

That interview is rather quite harsh, I&#039;m surprised Brad continued to answer questions half way through.  Reading both staff and manager interviews is rather revealing though, that Brad literally had no control or managerial balls to actually pull off a project like this.

Shame really.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To be more ontopic about Sigil, that McQuaid interview was chock full of lies and half-truths.

And he&#039;s a coward who somehow finds the strength to post and &quot;do interviews&quot; like a methhead at 1 or 2 or 3 in the morning.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Tseric might have quit... he needed to, certainly. Although after melting down in public, I certainly would have expected them to at least transfer him to another dept. if not show him the door. Poor guy. He really needed to quit a few months earlier.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know if Brad&#039;s batshit crazy or not, but it&#039;s obvious neither he nor Jeff Butler should have anything to do with management ever again.

And holy crap, ONE guy in QA all that time?]]></description>
