					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;People always come up with crazy stories to explain account sharing/selling&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Heh well my account info would not match my identity at the moment because when I got in on the trial  about 16 months or so  ago I figured I would just create a new name and the like when the trial ended. I instead ended up buying the game on the third or fourth day of the trial  so I am eternally known to Blizzard as Joe Smith.

And yes I could have deleted and started over but I have this aversion to deleting my first character in any MMO, and that first toon is now a  lil 70 running around Outlands .]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was farming Thorium in Un&#039;Goro one day and stopped at a Rich Thorium Vein just as another farmer arrived. He TOOK TURNS with me farming the vein.

We never spoke, but I was so dumbstruck at this show of good will I added him to my friends list.  I still see him pop up from time to time.  Maybe someday I&#039;ll have the chance to do something really nice for him and ask him if he remembers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is always retarded people like this,  I was clearing near the fortress in Nagrand for a quest to pick up boxes of er can&#039;t remember for some ogre on my alt shadowpriest.  I cleared an entire 2 buildings (cos they attack you through the wall gg bliz) and about 5 others and there were 2 left before I could grab 4-5 boxes to complete the quest, some rtard comes running up and attacks the two remaining mobs, and declares that the quest items were his because he cleared it.

One of those quests where you should really be a rogue to cut out 90% of the mob clearing and just get to the parts you wanna do :P]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Heh. Reminds me of a &#039;conversation&#039; I had this very morning. I get to a tin node at the same moment as someone else. They hadn&#039;t been fighting a guarding monster or anything (in which case I would have done my usual thing of leaving it to them); we just had a coincidence of timing. So naturally I dug in, figuring hey, whichever of us happens to dig it up faster is a lucky person. They immediately say, &quot;haha, thief&quot;. To which I replied simply, &quot;we got here at the same time.&quot;

By their own logic, I had as much right to that node as they did, seeing as we arrived at the same time. But I guess since they&#039;d decided it belonged to them, I was a thief. The shame. I&#039;ll never live it down. *sniff*]]></description>
