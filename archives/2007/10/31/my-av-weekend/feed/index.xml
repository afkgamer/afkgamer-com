					<description><![CDATA[We could assume that he said something really really rude, and wanted to look like a nice guy so he covered it up, or we could assume that the short reply was his and he just said something like &quot;rofl&quot; and didn&#039;t want to make a big deal about it. Either way he lied to us as readers. lol.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Note on that SS where the guy is ignoring you. I see you blanked out a section which you call &quot;un-related tell&quot;, but then just below that, you see &quot;Kal**** is ignoring you&quot; in red text. Now if that the &quot;un-related tell&quot; part was really a un-related tell, and you replyed nothing back to him, then you wouldn&#039;t have gotten the messege &quot;Kal** is ignoring you&quot;. You only get the ignore messege after a player has ignored you and you have sent something back to them in response. Just wanted to note that. Loved your blog.

					<description><![CDATA[Wowpanda, 

Don&#039;t give up on your Fire Mage just yet. Methinks you have the wrong build. Go Arcane up to Slow, be sure you have Presence of Mind... Go Fire to Pyroblast... make a macro for Trinket--&#062;PoM--&#062;Arcane Power--&#062;Pyroblast--&#062;...Reduel your Icemage friend. &#039;Keep your Powder Dry&#039;, dont waste it on his fire ward.  If your spell damage is no less than 750 you will have a fair chance at that mystical 6K Crit. 

All in case you didnt know. =)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Torcie,

Sounds like you were in my BG last night!  Only benefit is playing as a holy priest makes you fairly hard to kill by anything less than huge crits.  But there I sat, alone in towers, hoping it would change before someone ran in to off me.  

PvP is much more fun on my &#039;lock.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you have three people together defending flags, you can actually prevent your own team from progressing on offence.  They can&#039;t help it, they HAVE to stop and help.

EVERYONE wants to help you when there is three people.  

Yet, they see are perfectly happy to ride straight past an obviously holy priest being besieged by &#039;locks rogues and druids if s/he is on his/her own.]]></description>
