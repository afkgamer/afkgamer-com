					<description><![CDATA[I like a lot of these changes. I hope this forces more interaction between the 2 opposing forces in terms of PVP combat. Since 2.2 AV has become a run like hell to Drek or Vann; mostly because horde is now taking part of AV rather then AFKave and alliance wants to win. but I have been in games where alliance (me) would lose AV and still come out with more honor points because we were able to take both mines, kill galv, burn 4 towers, and cap 3 GYs. 

IMO this should not happen. The winners should always come up with more points for winning.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So the biggest problem, that on alliance you can run right to the general and kill him within minutes, but on horde you can&#039;t, has not been fixed. Linking them really does nothing since everyone does an FD pull anyway.

So what is the point of all this other crap if they don&#039;t fix the one huge glaring problem?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For the most part I think these are positive changes.  Even though I&#039;ve spent a depressing percentage of my life in that battleground over the years, there are times, especially when playing defense, that AV can be really, really fun.  95% of the time, it&#039;s mind-numbingly boring, but that one game out of 20 where everything just clicks is some of the most fun I have playing this game.

Hopefully these changes put the emphasis back on PVP.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmm... I&#039;m not really sure how I feel about this at the moment.

Certainly, something needs to be done about the current AV to change it back from a PVE style honor farm into a real PVP contest.  I think I did a dozen matches during the last bonus honor weekend, and after each one, nobody on either team had more than 10 honorable kills.

But at the same time, I&#039;m *really* not sure I like the idea that Joe Pickup Group, who joins the level 70 AV at 61 and goes around getting owned over and over by the Alliance will be directly causing our team to lose.]]></description>
