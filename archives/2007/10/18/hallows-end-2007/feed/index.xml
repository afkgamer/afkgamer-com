					<description><![CDATA[Just had a go at this last night and apart from our MT d/cing once, it was great fun :D 

I LOVE how they give you sticky treats to run out and reset it faster even. Managed to get both the healer ring and the caster one for spelldamage (read: boosting) set, casterless groups for the win ;)

The fire-putting-out event is rather too. If only you could get away with shoving hollow pumpkins onto strangers&#039; heads IRL. Or turning them into bats for that matter ^^]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Actually, I was quite impressed with the entire event. Whoever came up with this one deserves a raise, it is that good. It beats other &quot;seasonal&quot;/special events hands down.

The loot that drops actually seems pretty nice. The massive quantites of brooms can certainly be used to sweep up the bones from the front of the instance entrance. Even now, four days later, it is still standing room only.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great event, very worthwhile (the healer ring is identical to an epic Sha&#039;tar rep ring).  I just casually ran this a few times with guildies and pug&#039;s and managed to get the epic broom and healing ring.  

Little things like this make the game very enjoyable.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;it&#039;s probably a riding one if it&#039;s useable in SW right?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That could be.  He has one of the epix, but we all have the junk ones too from multiple zone runs.  My envy prevented me from asking which he was using at the time.

EDIT:  P.S.  This is the best goddamn world event script they&#039;ve ever created.  Nice (not OP) rewards for max levels, not annoying to rerun on a reasonable timer, and clever script.
