					<description><![CDATA[@Foton:  It depends where in the US you&#039;re at.  If you&#039;re in the southwest, like me, winter lasts from about Dec. 1st until Dec. 7th (give or take a few days).  :P

All these stories make me glad I quit the &quot;hardcore raiding&quot; scene.  It seems to attract a rather unique group of people.  Like the one GL on our server who slept with two different MTs in her guild and got pregnant by one IIRC.  So sad and yet so entertaining at the same time.  Keep em coming!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One of the last guilds I was in while playing DAoC had the equivalent of this paladin as the guildleader.  Fortunately, her being on the other coast prevented the horrid psychodrama with one of my real life friends from going completely over the top.

Well, okay, no...it didn&#039;t.  But at least nobody caught any diseases.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Michael, Ya, some people don&#039;t have that sense of what is too much to share with the public/casual acquaintances. (witness:  just about any Myspace)  Quite a few overestimate the importance or durability of game friendships.

@Morphene, I dunno how we find these people.  Maybe I&#039;m nosier than most so I&#039;m aware of these peccadillos.  We do talk alot in 5-mans, and we&#039;re gossips.  Obviously.  :)

@Ramada, I&#039;m in the United States, so winter is late December thru early March.  (right?)  Meeting was either late February/early March of this year.

@Ghost, thanks.  I probably should write a novel and I&#039;ll bet I could finish it while raiding and waiting for afk raiders.  But that&#039;s another rant entirely.

@Staarkhand, no, we all don&#039;t live close to each other which makes this even weirder.  The man-whore above FLIES to meet his game girls.  (That&#039;s why we call his trips F*** Vacations.)  His job does not involve travel so I&#039;m not sure how he works this into his schedule.  Altho, life in a close-knit raiding guild is something like living in a commune, eh?

@Van Hemlock, hard to keep everyone straight without a playbill, huh?  HunterSister was ManWhore&#039;s April 2007 F*** Vacation.  BawdyPaladin was ManWhore&#039;s Summer F*** Vacation.  He&#039;s been sulking too much lately to line up his next F*** Vacation.]]></description>
