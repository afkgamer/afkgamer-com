					<description><![CDATA[I ..  I mean ...  I ...

I&#039;ll take &quot;speechless&quot; for 200$ Alex please.

PS : I really enjoy your BLOG and the little adventures you share with us but for the love of everything that is holy, please never never never transfer or re-roll on my server.  I would be too affraid that some (or even just one for that matter) of your guildies or ex-guildies would follow you.

Nothing personal, hope you understand : )]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;so I shot him&quot;

I love that it was said as casually as &quot;I spilled milk on the counter, so I wiped it up with a sponge&quot;.

Like it was the only logical response.

And what I&#039;d really like to know (or actually, maybe I don&#039;t...) is how a shooting is considered a &quot;hate crime&quot;. I would call it attempted murder, personally. And why wasn&#039;t the other gentleman charged with assault? Wow.... so many boggling details, that I&#039;m sure I&#039;m much happier not knowing.]]></description>
