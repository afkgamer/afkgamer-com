					<description><![CDATA[Possibly an undocumented server hotfix messed this.  

I had done Shadow Labs a couple of times after the key piece nerf -- we killed the key shard elite before Murmur, the 2 people that needed could both loot it.  Either you had a bugged instance or Blizz messed it up with hotfixes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[On 2/24 five man killed the shard carrying elemental prior to killing murmur. But only 1 person could loot the shard, when he did the shard was not lootable by others. This is why I was looking at this line of chat to see if it had changed to the first person only getting the key shard. We were all the original group that got to that point. 
Or is it possible that you now need to kill murmur first for all to loot and if you kill the shard first only 1 can. Don&#039;t know but this is what happened.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When someone bends down to pick up the key part, it spawns a lvl 71 elite now and when you kill him you can loot the key part.  So you can still get 5 key parts if you clear to the the key shard then draft in the guildies that need it (rarely a full 5 man needs it) kill the elite loot shard then swap back over.

Was expecting more druid nerfs tbh, where is the warrior love?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That was meant with more humour than it sounds, it was early.

I now think I&#039;ve read it wrong anyway... It just means you have to be part of the initial party right? I thought it was like the AQ opening... first party gets the only keys... 

Like I said, it was early...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Part of getting keyed for Karazhan involves accessing quest items that are located within level 70 5-mans (Shadow Labs, Steamvaults, Arcatraz).
