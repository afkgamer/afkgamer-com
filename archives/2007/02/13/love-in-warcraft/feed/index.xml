					<description><![CDATA[I was hoping to spent a little time with my man doing something romantic in WoW (do not read: cyber tyvm), as we can&#039;t be together due to a few hundred miles but he can&#039;t make it, so maybe I&#039;ll just swan about and complete that quest for a change..

bah humbug.

Also a friend of mine is cooking his girlfriend dinner, nothing unusual there, but I&#039;m making his menu for him... WoW stylee, should be good!]]></description>
