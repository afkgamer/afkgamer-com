					<description><![CDATA[This may be the dumbest scheme I&#039;ve ever seen, but I will tip my hat to these folks at Seriosity if they manage to make some (actual) currency from it.  Free Tip:  cash out quickly before your customers catch on.  In my world, the important peer-to-peer communication occurs almost exclusively over IM.  Email is just for official corporate crap.  Perhaps the most ridiculous aspect of this is that there is no amount of money, real or virtual, that can make a clueless management drone actually read an important email from a technical person.   The only way to get the point across is to arrive as an expert outside consultant with a PowerPoint presentation and charge $175/hour plus expenses.  But if I have to, I&#039;ll play the system for sure.  All my email chits will be gone on Monday morning, and I&#039;ll just route all incoming to the trash.  If the virtual currency ever shows up as real money in my paycheck, then every server in the data center will have to start sending me minute by minute updates...cha-ching!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This idiotic idea obviously came from someone who has never stepped foot in a large office before.  I work as a performance analyst for a fairly large bank, and part of my job involves emailing over 3000 department heads, managers, assistant managers and various other suited retards...

Do I do this because I want to?  Because I have an email addiction?  No, I do it because its part of my job, a job i&#039;d lose if I sat back and refused to send figures out because my currency pot was low; or if I was caught passing notes to the rotund and oddly scented girl sitting behind me &quot;GIMME 10CREDS PLEEZ&quot;]]></description>
