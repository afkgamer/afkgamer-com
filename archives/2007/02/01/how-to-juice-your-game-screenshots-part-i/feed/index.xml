					<description><![CDATA[Photoshop elements (of which most of which is done here is available) can be downloaded on a trial basis and I&#039;ve also seen it free with some media items (like scanners and I got one with my Nikon 8700 as well), I&#039;ve also seen it on PC magazine cdroms as well.

Getting to grips with Elements is allot easier than Cs2 (obviously) but is rewarding even just for &#039;shopping&#039; screenshots, but when you apply the same to Photo&#039;s and scans the results can be amazing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Outstanding guide. Looking forward to the rest!

I use Photoshop in my day-job a  lot and no longer trust any &#039;photographic proof&#039; any more, and often have trouble remembering which photos in the library are real and which aren&#039;t.

Definitely the first thing to do with *any* image you&#039;re working with though, is go straight for the Image -&#062; Adjustment... -&#062; Levels... option. Shocking how much information is lost because the graph is all bunched up at one end.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great idea for a post.  Only thing that came to mind is that the average yokle probably doesnt have Photoshp and if they do, since it costs so much, they better know how to get their money&#039;s worth.

True Story... Dated a professional photographer some years back who wasn&#039;t very PC savvy yet.  I helped get started using Photoshop and he got me started in digital photography as a hobby.  About 3 years into our relationship a friend of his, has a sister getting married and the bride&#039;s brother was killed in a car crash the week before the wedding.

Still reeling, the family really wanted him in the family picture that was taken at the wedding ceremony so they asked us if we could digitally insert him into the picture.  My first thought was how morbid and I mean - he wasn&#039;t actually there and won&#039;t that photo always remind them of his death?

The gave us a picture of him in swimming trunks on the beach to work with.  Using Photoshop we were able to grab a tuxedo from an online catalog, fit it on to him, insert him into the photo right beside the father and then adjust the lighting and shading on his face to simulate the lighting in the photo.  When we were done, it looked very convincing!

It was certainly an odd thing to do but goes to show you want creativity and technology can do.  Never done anything that strange since and probably never will. :-)]]></description>
