					<description><![CDATA[Fade doesn&#039;t scale.  It&#039;s a SET NUMBER of -threat for 10 seconds.  So I can be sitting there, hitting fade, and the mob will still be hitting for me for 2k a pop due to my cloth.  Totally balanced with a complete aggro wipe in Divine Shield for 12 seconds along with a stun... Not to mention the innate -40% aggro reduction for paladin heals.

Healing as a holy priest is a complete joke.  There are 4 healing classes, and the priest is the least valuable of them.  The priest has the least survability due to cloth and a craptastic one-shottable shield at 70.  The druid can go into bear form, the shaman has mail+shield+frostshock/earthbind kite, the paladin has plate+shield+bubble+stun+lay on hands.

If that doesn&#039;t sound unbalanced, consider that for the basic same output in healing, the priest has the least amount of utility for the raid.  Stacking druids/shamans/paladins bring far more in terms of other abilities, like blessings, auras, totems, bloodlusts/heroisms, innervates, combat rezzes, reincarnations, divine interventions, lay on hands, etc.  You name it, the priest doesn&#039;t have it.

I don&#039;t know why the hell I&#039;m still playing my priest.  People say oh oh we need priests.  What the hell for?!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t play my priests any more.
Paladin is such a nicer healing class... it&#039;s insane. The main difference now I think is the way they nerf item healing scaling, pallies sort of always had that with flash of light anyway, and now priests don&#039;t. There are so many talents pallies have that reduce mana and give mana back.. I barely have to drink unless its after a near-wipe-circumstances pull.

My most recent discovery is a new talent that reduces mana cost of spells by 50% for the next 15seconds... and if you happen to crit during that, you get 100% of the spell&#039;s mana cost back when you only spent 50%... gg free mana!

From healing as a pally (66) , I went back to my shadow priest (64)  healing in decent healing gear, and obviously its alright as long as the fights are short and lots of drinking time.

Then I went over to my holy priest (untouched at 60) expecting to have a much easier time healing in ramparts, and the differences between full-shadow healing and holy/disc healing were depressingly minimal. I think I even burn mana faster healing than when shadow dpsing.

Also, being a squishy sucks. Fade just doesnt cut bubble, or hammer of justice... let alone plate armor to hide in.

Maybe I&#039;ve just gimped my own healing style by going &#039;easymode&#039; pally healing and &#039;can&#039;t&#039; heal as a priest anymore... 

I don&#039;t know. I feel sorry for priests, I help them out whenever I can. 

Holy paladin and shadow priest make for a beautiful combination, however.

This said I&#039;m not even 70 yet and haven&#039;t experience any of the new-end-game.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[No, the priest is supposed to be a &quot;pure healer.&quot; But consider this: a holy specced priest has basically the same amount of mana as a holy specced paladin -- however, a holy specced paladin does not go into another tree to pick up talents to help healing.  All holy talents help healing immensely, and the +% intellect talent which is deep inside the discipline tree for priests is the easiest to access talent for paladins.

Also consider that in BC, a shadowpriest DPSing with a holy paladin main healing has more synergy than a shadowpriest DPSing with a holy priest main healing.  Why?  Spiritual attunement, which allows the paladin to passively regain mana from others&#039; healing, including vampiric embrace healing from a shadowpriest.  Many heroic instance groups have taken to a holy paladin MAIN healing instead of a holy priest, because their mana simply lasts longer, they have more healing per second after talents (light&#039;s grace 2.0 sec heal that heals for 4k instead of greater heal 2.5 sec that heals for a similar amount), and they have far superior damage mitigation through plate, shield, divine shield, blessing of protection, etc.

It sucks being outhealed by a healing hybrid, but Blizzard never really gives a crap about unhappy healers.  /shrug]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve gone strictly holy and reserve my priest for party-play (my rogue is for my soloing), as well as loading her up with a ton of healing gear, so she certainly doesn&#039;t play like a hybrid class. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Heather, actually... according to Blizzard, priest is a hybrid.  We&#039;re a healing/dps hybrid.  And we&#039;re supposed to compete with other healing hybrids for healing, not outclass them in every scenario.  That&#039;s pretty much what has happened, and as a result priests have less mana efficiency / less longetivity / poorer healing output per second than paladins, and have far less survivability than other healing hybrids.

GG to us priests.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s misogyny everywhere; of course it&#039;s in WoW!  Most people are not misogynist, but there&#039;s a sizeable minority making everyone else look bad.

My guild has a lot of female players.  I think it&#039;s because overall the guild has attracted people who will treat women (and men, for that matter) with respect.  Quite a few couples play in our guild.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh damn!  I made a shaman when I came back to WoW four months ago, who&#039;s now 60.  I fit the stereotype!  What EVER shall I do now?  Maybe I should roll a mage.

My level 70 blood elf priest is also the typical female thing to play.  Oh and my 60 paladin -- from way back when WoW first came out -- must be another stereotypical female class.

Any female that plays anything must be stereotyped immediately.]]></description>
