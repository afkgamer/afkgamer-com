					<description><![CDATA[LOL. Due to this sidesplitting masterpiece, I think I&#039;m now going to have to read every page that Google suggests when I search, in the hope that more people take real life emotions into a virtual world and make themselves seem like crying little babies. LOL]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Always love these posts, part of me is laughing at them and part of me is going &quot;oh yeah, I remember the time when....&quot;  After that I usually post a link up on my guild&#039;s website.

With this post, my guild had a similar thing happen where our raid leader decided to stage a coup (originally planned at the time TBC went live, but word leaked out so he had to spring it early) that failed pretty miserably. He has managed to form a guild of a lot of the scrubs and drama queens of the server, and regualarly attacks members of our guild on the offical server forum, providing much of the entertainment for the rest of the server that reads the boards.  

My two questions are:  Have they tried to attack your guild publically on the forums (yet), and how many gold is the pool up to for the date when the &quot;guild that hates your guild&quot; goes nuclear?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Bizz, appreciate the compliment.  Folks, the lesson is:  always have a change of clothes at the office (or school).  That was good advice in kindergarten, it&#039;s good advice now.

Weekend Update on the Guild that Hates My Guild:  They&#039;ve apparently spawned a splinter guild, still entirely composed of players that hate my guild, but smaller in size.  We&#039;ve named them:  The Other Guild that Hates Our Guild.

So now we have two guilds united in hate.  That&#039;s a worldwide first, I believe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Foton,

I&#039;ve been visiting your log for almost a year now... I must say that it is one of the most entertaining logs on the web. Even in the past 8 months that i didn&#039;t play WoW i kept visiting, just for the great stories... I often wet myself whilst rolling on the ground and under the table; it&#039;s so damn funny! Please post more of these great stories in the future.

A big fan
