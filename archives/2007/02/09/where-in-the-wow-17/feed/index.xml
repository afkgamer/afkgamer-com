					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;I can report he has NO IDEA how to play the classes ... the one fight, he forced my rogue to use the bow. Mind control me if you must, but let me handle the combat. Jeezus.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I was throwing my throwing knives at a paladin... at least he had the sense to Cloak of shadows vs a warrior lol.  I think it&#039;s the final laugh at rogues from Blizzard really.  I see a shadowpriest using mindblast and mindflay, a warrior charging and using hamstring against people, paladins using seals and melee&#039;ing me to death and a mage pryoblasting the warrior ... and the rogue using throwing daggers.

But I do like Shadow Labyrinth, least it doesn&#039;t have multiple cleave mobs (as in a 5 mob pull all of which do a 1.5-2k AE cleave, hi2u shattered halls), allot of casting mobs which mean bringing a rogue makes life easier with stun/kicks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s true, he sucks at rogues.  Last time I ran it I was trying to blow all my cooldowns but managed to pop Cold Blood just before the MC hit.  

He basically ran me around skilling up my throwing (thanks!) and I ended the MC with Cold Blood still up...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Shadow Labyrinth&#039;s map is a lot like a maze.

(I tried that joke on my guild, TWO people got it.  TWO!)

The Refectory of Shadow Labyrinth, home of the mind-controlling douchebag, Blackheart the Inciter.  I can report he has NO IDEA how to play the classes ... the one fight, he forced my rogue to use the bow.  Mind control me if you must, but let me handle the combat.  Jeezus.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Shadow Labs!

It&#039;s the area for the boss that mind controls everyone. It&#039;s the non-Bloodlust fight, because if you use it on everyone, then everyone beats each other up. If you don&#039;t, the boss makes you just use it on yourself and waste it.

Fun fight, though. It&#039;s a bragging rights fight.]]></description>
