					<description><![CDATA[The one I use for the PvP battlegrounds...or did, pre-BC post 2.0 patch when we actually played them...was BOHICA.

Bend Over Here It Comes Again. 

Just shout it out at the beginning of the match. Someone is bound to ask what it means, and the chuckles are usually pretty decent at releasing some of the tension.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You pwn some major RL ass my friend! /salute

One thing I have noticed is that among gamers, even of console sort, there is a bit of shared language. I guess we can thank things like XBL for that. But still, WoW tends to also have it&#039;s own dialect. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I find myself in the same position.  Whenever I go back home for an extended family gathering, my 2 brothers and I end up talking about gaming, which means internetese creeps in of course.   The confused looks from my fundamental christian relatives (read: the most boring and judgemental people you will ever meet in your life) is the one thing I really look forward to.

And this year I will be talking about my new Pally, that class has all sorts of acronyms.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d be curious how many guilds have their own internetese. I know in my guild a former guildie came up with a gem I use all the time now. 

DIAPS
Die in a Prison Shower. 

(no offense meant to anyone who has suffered that tragic fate, but it&#039;s a great thing to you yell after you cap a flag or get an amazing crit and 2 shot someone in PVP.)]]></description>
