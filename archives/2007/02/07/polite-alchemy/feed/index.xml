					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve not specialised yet, and apart from the fact it looks like most have gone with transmutation, would the elixir or potion specialisation be more profitable as there is no cooldown?

					<description><![CDATA[I had this discussion with a fellow Alchemist.  I will be keeping all extras I make on transmutes unless there is some kind of other arrangement made.  There is a huge investment in Transmutation Mastery, and I shouldn&#039;t get nothing out of the time and effort I put into that mastery, not to mention blowing my cooldown time for someone.  I might split any procs with a guildmate, but even that is not guaranteed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with Elbows on this one. Due to the resources that go into specializing I&#039;d probably expect to keep the extra (excepting with Guildies... although if I was the Guildy getting the transmute I&#039;d tell &#039;em they could have the extra as a tip). However, I think Elbows&#039; suggestion of waiving any fee or tip in that instance is nice.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve already discussed this with some of the other Alchemists in our guild. We seem to agree that for guildies, you hand over the extra items. For non guildies, you keep them and don&#039;t tell the guy you just did the transmute or potions for.

Obviously this goes out the window if you don&#039;t like that guildy you just did the transmute for.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Alchemist put resources into his mastery, if you should earn 4 primal mights back from tips it will take forever to get a break even. Optional for the requester to buy the second primal at reduced price.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Depends really, if it&#039;s a guildy who is transmuting for me I&#039;m pretty sure (as we only have two that I supplied 60-70% of the mats to &lt;strong&gt;get &lt;/strong&gt;that mastery ) they will hand over both.  But I do not expect it and wouldn&#039;t be offended if I didn&#039;t get it.  If it was some shmo that was spamming it in the trade chan I wouldn&#039;t expect him to hand over both :)]]></description>
