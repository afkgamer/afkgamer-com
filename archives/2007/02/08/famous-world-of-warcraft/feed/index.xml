					<description><![CDATA[I have got to admit i laughed so hard reading this all the way to the bottom, it is true Females do tend to play casters and have melee/dps alts. I myself have a main priest and an alt hunter. It may be a general stereotype but its still hilarious. I know a few girls who dps&#039;s but very few who tank. As for celebrities, its nice and all but they wouldn&#039;t have the time to play it like we all do anyways so meh. I was merely out to prove a point to my sister that the game is more popular than she thinks it is, case closed really lol.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m female and I play a caster....

just thought i&#039;d add to that.

And anyone see Vin Diesel on Jonathan Ross&#039; show?
He admitted he played, and Rossy&#039;s wife plays too she&#039;s &quot;Green and rides a tiger&quot;
Troll? Night elf riding a nightsaber? 

I&#039;d like to know :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Regarding women that play:

I know at least 12 women that are attractive that play with their husbands, boyfriends, girlfriends, or solo. You don&#039;t have to be ugly or beautiful to cast innervate at the right time or cast FFB. Odd generalization though, most of the women I know, play casters :P&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That&#039;s funny, I happen to play with my Husband, and I play a Resto Druid.  I know several other gamer girls, and at least three other married couples that play WoW. I do believe all of the women/girls I know play casters.  Although some of them have melee/ranged alts, their mains are indeed casters...]]></description>
