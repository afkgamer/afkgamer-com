					<description><![CDATA[I think I want to punch the guy who wrote that &quot;Don&#039;t hate the makers, hate the game&quot; article.  He makes a couple of good points, but falls short in the end due to one factor:  Hating the makers is, vicariously, hating the game.  I don&#039;t know about the rest of you, but I play mostly because it&#039;s still fun (in a weird, masochistic way), I have friends in-game, and I&#039;ve invested too much time to just say &quot;Fuck it, I&#039;m done.&quot;  However, I certainly can&#039;t yell at the box I purchased to fix the nerf bombs being constantly rained down upon us, so I yell at Blizzard to fix it.  Mostly, because Blizzard are the only people who can.  The game certainly can&#039;t fix itself...

					<description><![CDATA[Ahh the mystery priest buff. Not to roll over too much, but a 6-10 second cool down on Prayer of Mending is about all I&#039;m hoping for.

Maybe they&#039;re changing Spirit of Redemption to a flying angel that drops bombs. I seem to spend most of my PvP time looking like an angel as it is.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That was it?
I thought that was just some emergency ooh-shit maneuver until they figure out/tell us what this Buff To Compensate All Non-buffage is :s

They also cancelled the non-patch-note pally nerf, which is a good thing. Nabs.]]></description>

Eyonix:&lt;blockquote&gt;The cooldown for Prayer of Mending is now going to be ten seconds, instead of fifteen. Additionally, we&#039;re improving the amount of damage mitigation Power Word: Shield gains from plus to healing by an additional ten percent, which is effectively double what it is now. Circle of Healing will cost 30% less mana, and we&#039;re also continuing to look into improving Light well, as well as analyzing priest survivability in both PvE and PvP. &lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If the priests ain&#039;t happy, ain&#039;t nobody happy.

There&#039;s been a few server public protests already, hosted by the priests and by the druids.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=79181702&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Another one is scheduled for today&lt;/a&gt;, Warsong server, starting in Stormwind, immediately or shortly after maintenance is completed.

It&#039;s been difficult for the organizers to get the word out since Castle Blizzard has been nuking and banning any WoW forum info -- well played, Blizzard, btw.  BUT, if you&#039;re looking for something to do later today, you might check out Warsong and see if anything interesting happens.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Also, thank you Foton for being such an awesome and understanding rogue.   Too many rogues just want priests to be free HKs and are calling Prayer of Mending overpowered (including the rogues in my guild).  They don&#039;t realize it&#039;s what&#039;s healing their asses when the boss does a cleave and it bounces between them and the tank.  They don&#039;t realize that the healing goes both ways -- a priest keeping themselves alive in PvP with a rogue is a rogue free to attack whatever is on the priest, and the priest can also use it to heal the rogue.  Imagine that!  A healer HEALING in PvP.

Love the smart rogues, and I&#039;ll miss ya&#039;ll.  To all the idiotic ones, good luck have fun don&#039;t miss us priests.]]></description>
