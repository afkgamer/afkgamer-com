					<description><![CDATA[If we only had more than one rogue, and he actually mutinied, this would so be the recent story of my guild!

As a side note, the raiders that split off number a mere 20, yet they have now cleared KZ including that optional nutjob dragon twice in two weeks...something the mega guild was unable to do ever.  Focused group ftw.  Is there a position between GoB and HB?  I need that job.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently /gquit from my raiding guild I&#039;ve spent the last year or so with. I considered myself one of the GOBs who forged ahead new content, paid repair bills, with hardly a purple to show for it. I left because they inflated their roster with purple-hungry kids that could raid from, oh, dinner time &#039;till the sun comes up. They are pulling Gruul and I&#039;m giving my kid a bath. 

They replaced skill with numbers, and numbers won, although now I hear they are wiping on content that was no trouble when the old-people with lives were around. Most of the old guard stayed on because they had nowhere else to go. I&#039;d take 1 skilled player vs. 5 unskilled yabos anytime in TBC.

If your new hated guild needs an undead warlock, let me know.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Raster - Wow the abyss sounds like a scary place. I&#039;m thinking you&#039;ve got the raid leader and the rogue officer that won&#039;t take any BS (except from healers) sounds like a solid foundation for a guild to me. The state of raider recruitment is really the suck right now though...]]></description>
