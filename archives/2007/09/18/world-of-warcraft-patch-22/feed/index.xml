					<description><![CDATA[The one time I tried voice chat on the PTR it was really quiet. Not sure if I just didn&#039;t have the settings right or what. Of course, it was really late on a Saturday after a raid and I was pretty drunk at the time. 

Hmmm...drunk, tired raiders doing beta testing. Maybe that&#039;s Blizz&#039;s trouble with patching.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I predict I will get a very bad finger cramp from mouse clicking the mute button.
