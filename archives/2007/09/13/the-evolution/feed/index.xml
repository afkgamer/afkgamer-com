					<description><![CDATA[i think ppl have this fantasy about the perfect raid guild where everyone logs on at the right time, ppl know their class, bring their own consumables, etc. 
personally, i don&#039;t believe that guild exists. you just can&#039;t get 25 ppl scattered over the globe to act with that kind of synchronization. getting them to do ANYTHING together is part of the challenge of the game, imo.

regarding ppl&#039;s comments about /o:
my old guild grew to be two guilds in one. you had the ppl in /o and the ppl in /gu, and the /o ppl absolutely bitched about the /gu ppl. it was bad for the guild and eventually turned into a split. the /o ppl left (and formed my current guild) and the /gu ppl had to pick up the pieces. 

i learned from the experience. when i formed my new guild, i set the ranks to be officer-free. we have two active GMs and, when it&#039;s raid time, a channel for raid assistants that acts as a temporary /o just for that raid (tank assistant, dps, healing. that&#039;s it). 

imo, it&#039;s really cut down on the level of drama caused by cliques and secrecy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;(Moroes can be a bitch with one shackle, btw.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Then there&#039;s the fun way - doing it with no shackle and two hunters.  You shouldn&#039;t be able to throw a brick without finding hunters &quot;lfg kara lol&quot;.

(disclosure: I play a hunter, and flawlessly kiting/trapping Moroes&#039;s MS warrior buddy makes me all warm and fuzzy inside.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[No priests in Kara was a common occurrence for our guild - even in 25-mans we have MAYBE two shadow priests show up, only one regular. We got real good at kiting melee mobs around the banquet table while we killed the casters. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Well. I would not wish this kind of edgy combat on anyone -- where the raid/Vent call is &#039;holy priests, throw up dots!&#039;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

lol Great, now I&#039;m having Ony flashbacks :p

Thanks for sharing your adventures with us. Hope there&#039;s many more ahead.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well.  I would not wish this kind of edgy combat on anyone ... where the raid/Vent call is &quot;holy priests, throw up dots!&quot;  

And they did, and we won, and I am amazed at how lucky we are with our healing core.  They can DOT!  They can HOT!  They can POM!  They can Rammel-lammel-dingdong!   (Fortunately, none of them are Lightwelling.)]]></description>
