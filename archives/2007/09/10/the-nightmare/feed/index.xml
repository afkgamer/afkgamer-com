					<description><![CDATA[@Yunk

You&#039;d be surprised how spectacularly that can fail, as well. What started as a plan for my faction to be the hardcore and the other to be the feeder guild turned disastrous.  Unfortunately, I was on the losing end of the drama.  And in Shadowbane, losing meant salted earth.  Later, they instituted a policy where aiding or abetting &quot;traitors&quot; was grounds for guild dismissal in my honor.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I always thought in those situations it would be better to split into two guilds. one would be the casual and leveling and feeder guild for the other. No drama that way, and everyone gets to do what they want. What&#039;s wrong with letting people do what they want?

But I&#039;ve never met a guild leader that was willing to do that (except I think Psae did it with his guild). So instead people leave and then there&#039;s no relation between the guilds. what good is that?]]></description>
