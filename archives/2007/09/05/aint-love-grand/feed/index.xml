					<description><![CDATA[Bah. My husband was my best friend before we started dating, and now we&#039;ve been together for 10 years and married for 6. Quite happily. Wouldn&#039;t have it any other way.

This rant is hysterical. I wonder if this guy has any idea how silly it makes him look?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[no way. a lot about that ladder system is true, but i take issue with this line:
&quot;I feel like I can talk to you about anything&quot;
they claim it signifies to a man that he&#039;s on the friends ladder, but in my world (unless he&#039;s gay) it means, &quot;hey buddy, i&#039;m taking you OFF the friends ladder and opening up new possibilities.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is hysterical and I apologize in advance for the forthcoming lenghty comment.  I never knew about this data but it&#039;s SO spot-on.

Many years ago I was hanging out regularly with a man who was obviously on my Friend&#039;s ladder.  Before this span of being single, I&#039;d been married to my HS sweetheart for 14 years.  Therefore despite my age, I was quite the dating noob.  Anywho...one night when he was leaving my house after having had dinner there, he kissed me at the door.  I WAS LIVID!  So yes, he go the proverbial kick to the head and lucky it wasnt a kick to the balls instead.

I let him know in no uncertain terms that we were just friends and it was that or hit the door for good.  He was graceful about it and decided he&#039;d rather just be friends than nothing.  Dial forward 4 months and we&#039;re dating...6 months and we live together...2 years and he&#039;s the love of my life...5 more spent in blissful heaven... 2 more and oops, all over.  Ah well, definitely better to have loved and loss in this case.

The only thing regretful is someone who jumps from friends ladder to the other, is a much larger loss once it&#039;s over and they&#039;re gone. So beware of allowing ladder jumpers! LOL]]></description>
