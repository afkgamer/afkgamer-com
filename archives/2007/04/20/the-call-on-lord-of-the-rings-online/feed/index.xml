					<description><![CDATA[Update on the cost information -- now that the beta is over, the cost of subscription has gone up to $15  a month (if you pay for an entire year at a time, it&#039;s around $12 a month).  And there&#039;s no more &quot;lifetime memberships.&quot;

					<description><![CDATA[I tried, I really did, but I can&#039;t bring myself to care. I played in the beta for about 10 hours. Everything looks so normal when you compare it to WoW: humans; houses; fields; swamps. Where are the 400 foot tall glowing blue mushrooms? Where are the frothing neon-green rivers?

It&#039;s probably one of the reasons I like playing Horde so much. Sometimes I think that the character type you roll is a sort of Rorschach test. Why would you create a standard looking human when you could be a 10 foot tall cow with a broken horn, or a dead guy with half a face wearing bondage straps all over?

I think I stopped playing the Sims for the same reason. Although I found it a fascinating game, I remember one night watching my little pixelated self take a shower, and I realized that I should probably get up and take a shower.

That way lies the abyss.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, in a few months money won&#039;t be a problem.  As soon as people hit 50, do monster play, mess around with new the new content and decide to roll an new character they will want to twink that character in the best stuff available.  The first place they are gonna go is the auction house and they&#039;ll be lining the pockets of everyone selling.  So, as long as you don&#039;t expect the quests or mobs to just hand out cash and you actively trade on the auction house, money should be good.  Hell, I&#039;m not poor as it is and all I&#039;ve been doing is selling stuff for people to buy and grind up their tradeskills.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;5. Money is too tight. I know game economies have to be guarded closely lest inflation ruins everything, but in the noob levels, we want to try everything.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I actually like this feature in games.  I&#039;d rather the game start out challenging and get easier than the other way around.  Plus, I like re-rolling, and I&#039;m going to do it a bunch anyway, so a system that encourages makes me feel like I&#039;m wasting less of my time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@saccia,

Just install XP/Vista on your Mac via Boot Camp (as a separate partition).
You get the greatness of OS X, and the ability to reboot to Windows to play games.

Been doing it with LotRO ever since I got into closed beta 3 months ago.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jay, now you know why you got pwned by the &quot;Make the Switch&quot; commercials.  OSX is nice and all but I would NEVER have only a Mac.  Heck, I have 5 machines as it is.  With the &quot;Games for Windows&quot; program, you can look forward to more disappointment as well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmm... when I was in beta I found the combat system so slow and boring that I quickly gave up all hope that this game would ever amount to anything.

					<description><![CDATA[This has just about killed it for me:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Question/Topic
Can I play The Lord of the Rings: Shadows of Angmar on my Macintosh?
Answer/Article

Currently, The Lord of the Rings: Shadows of Angmar only supports Windows XP and Vista. There are no plans at this time to make a Macintosh compatible version.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although I can buy either Vista or XP and run it on my Intel Mac, I refuse to do so just to play one game. Now maybe if they got with the folks at Transgaming and used Cider (Mac wrapper for Windows games) I&#039;d probably look twice at this. Until then, not gonna happen.]]></description>
