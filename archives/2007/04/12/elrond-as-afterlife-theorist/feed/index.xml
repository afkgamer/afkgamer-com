					<description><![CDATA[@Cindy, Huh?  Not enough fun elements because it sticks to the Tolkien Universe?  That makes no sense.  Every MMO has to stick to some idea of a Universe and what fits and what doesn&#039;t.  Just because the game sticks to the Tolkien Universe doesn&#039;t mean that Turbine can&#039;t extend the story in any way.  Large parts of the current Epic quest line have nothing to do with the main storyline in the Lord of the Rings books and are focused more on the background story that was present in Lord of the Rings.  Remember, this is (at least the initial story) about the Shadows of Angmar so it&#039;s more about the Witch King rather than directly about Sauron in Mordor.]]></description>
