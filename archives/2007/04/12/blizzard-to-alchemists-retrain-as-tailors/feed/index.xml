					<description><![CDATA[Looks like adding timesinks to me, so that people won&#039;t progress too fast. Pots substituted for gear, allowing to try new bosses before farming previous ones through and through. Now raiders will generally spend more time getting gear, making the content last longer. Way to go. 

As for re-tuning - don&#039;t be silly. They won&#039;t touch anything.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That better be some serious retuning they do to encounters. They just basically kicked every class in the nuts with those patch notes. Although I guess Beast Mastery specced Hunters got a little love.

Why Blizzard keeps trying to make Hunters use pets in raids, but only take half measures to make pets viable, I will never know. For instance this Avoidance skill will be useless if you havetot get rid of one of your other major defensive  focuses up to take it (ie Natural Armor, Greater Stamins, Resistance etc)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[They&#039;re making huge changes to alchemy, but the only professions that can change spec are leatherworkers and tailors?  Is this still April fools?  I can&#039;t think of another explanation for something that stupid.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh dear, this sounds like a nerf of my favourite mining spot, too:

The location of many of the Outland mineral nodes have been adjusted both to put them in locations that are more traveled and to make them more likely to be near creatures.

:(
Well at least it&#039;s the weekend...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[*bends over*
*cries*

Nice buffs to fishing though, I&#039;m glad I do that more than actual alchemy...

OOOF.

If I can just ignore all that it actually means... it&#039;s a nice laugh to start off friday with. 
Hahaha.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah I saw all that and i&#039;m like wtf. Unless some SERIOUS retuning happens this is a huge nerf for raids. 

Of course i&#039;m a Leather worker so hell i&#039;m used to the ache in my back from staying bent over this long. I just need to remember to say Hi to the Alchemists when they get down here.]]></description>
