					<description><![CDATA[Karazhan is annoying, and mostly worthless from a gear standpoint, but is far from difficult.   Attuman and Shade are the only bosses that cause respawn issues of any real magnitude, and 9 blind monkeys could down attuman.   

The biggist issue with the zone is the sprawl.  Even moving full speed with no wipes and one shots, we can&#039;t finish the damn place in a night.    To me, that is the most frustrating part.  I wouldn&#039;t mind 1 night a week running it to help guildies get their gear, but damn, two night so we can get 2 people their marginal  gear upgrades and the Shammies get their 12th Helm?

A solid fix to Karazhan would be the removal of the Broken Stair entirely, get rid of the bullshit packs in front of Curator, get rid of the Arcane Annialators and the mana Feeders in the Library and cut the spell shade/ Mana packs past Illhoof in half at least, and we&#039;d have a one-nighter kind of instance.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, they&#039;ll *tune* them alright. Bosses will hit for 25 less damage because you can&#039;t have elixer of mastery and fort flask up at the same time. And they will all have their HP reduced by 5000.

Cause 1 less frost bolt to worry about will be great when I have 250 less spell damage.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[agreed, karazhan is another shining example of bliz expecting everyone to play 4+hrs a day.

nobody likes grinding 30/45 min to get to a 5 min encounter they get 2 or 3 shots at before having to grind again.  but this is a business decision

one day some game developer will take a stand against bullshit timesinks like 30 min trash respawns.]]></description>
