					<description><![CDATA[As of 6pm eastern, the queued servers are Brandywine, Landroval, Silverlode, and Elendilmir.  I&#039;d avoid those, cuz I hate crowds of any kind.  Nimrodel, Vilya, Arkenstone, and Firefoot are new today, those might be good choices.

EDIT:  just redid my graphics settings, to max performance and loveliness, and hot damn those hi-res textures are eye-popping!

EDIT2:  where in the FUCK is the goddamn white hand thrasher?????  and can we get a functional spoiler site??  Christ.  I&#039;ve spent 58 years (game time, estimated) looking for the frikking thrasher.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Foton
=) not a problem Bro. 


I have been reading the http://forums.lotro.com/ and there is no mention of the existing servers that are currently. Can any other posted recommend  good server that is adequately populated and not to hard core on the RP side. 
I like to enjoy MMOs as a game only and those that think I&#039;m actually an elf. That is why I enjoy WOW so much.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@ Steven - Denied.  :)  But you can ask any questions here and there&#039;s sure to be someone more knowledgeable than me to answer.

					<description><![CDATA[thank you so much for waxing rhapsodic about the appeal of lotro. I now have an intel mac with boot camp that can run the game, have been playing the open beta for about a week, and am totally hooked. I admit I&#039;m a crafting goob, and I love that the crafts tend to be real, time-sink PROFESSIONS in this game rather than ho-hum adjuncts the way they ended up in WoW.

yes, I&#039;m altogether too proud of my master apprentice farmer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I gave up WoW due to healer burnout and boredom with the endgame repetition.  I have a VG account, but it&#039;s currently too hardcore for my casual play an hour or two here and there play style.  LOTRO seems to fit me better, and the fact that I will pay $200 and get a &quot;lifetime&quot; subscription makes it seem even better (i.e. I have no real obligation to play, since I don&#039;t see a bill each month).

But back to Foton&#039;s post, point 5 is key.  Each starter area has a quest to kill a named mob, and because of the ease of killing it, the spot quickly turns into an overcamped, anonymous, kill-steal fest.  Do everyone a favor and group up!]]></description>
