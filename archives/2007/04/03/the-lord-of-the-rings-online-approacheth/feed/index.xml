					<description><![CDATA[I dunno, I think I&#039;m gonna hold off for Conan.  I&#039;m getting sick of WoW, but LOTRO doesn&#039;t look to be my style so far.  Then of course when my true master comes calling I&#039;ll be going to Warhammer.

Blood for the blood god!  Skulls for the skull throne!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Criticizing the animation?  I thought the animation was good as well.  Look at the swimming animations.  In each direction you swim in, you have different swimming techniques: breaststroke, backstroke, and sidestroke.  I thought they paid good attention to actually making the animation more realistic.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[And what&#039;s with the animation hate?  I think my Captiain&#039;s moves are pretty slick.  No, I don&#039;t look hot like I did in WOW, but I didn&#039;t look hot in previous MMOs either so, what&#039;s yer point?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As much as I disliked giving my money to Turbine (still harboring AC2 hate), I did.  LOTRO is a good game - it&#039;s not great, but it&#039;s also not WOW.  I&#039;m like really over WOW.  I could probably eek a few more months out of it with some incentive.  I&#039;m about to be Kara keyed and I joined a new guild that&#039;s heading there soon.  If I had no other options I could drain some more life out of it for that, and one more reason I don&#039;t want to mention just yet.

I&#039;d rather wait for War, am not so interested in Conon, but hell I need something to play now.  I&#039;m back to playing The Sims2, if you really need a visual on how tired I am of WOW.  So LOTRO will suffice for now and might surprise me a last even longer.  I love crafting and this is closer to a real crafting system than WOW ever had or will have.  So if I&#039;m going to go, I figured I might as well join in style as a Founder.

I look forward to bumping into or reading about the adventures anyone has who&#039;s been on WOW but giving LOTRO a try.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll admit that LOTRO&#039;s character models and animation stray near the uncanny valley and are overall not top shelf material.  And I&#039;ll admit these things may be important to the overall success of an MMO.  

Personally, though, I don&#039;t care.  The game looks nice and character models have nothing to do with long term playability.  The time it takes for me to stop noticing character models altogether is measured in weeks.  Turbine may miss those people who won&#039;t play the game because their elf isn&#039;t hawt enough, but I won&#039;t.  From my point of view WoW-level popularity is a liability, and I think it would be much more disruptive to Middle Earth than Azeroth.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@jason

Aye the skin and facial features remained relatively unchanged. The armor did get more detailed as well. Though that is hard to notice the difference from high to very high unless one actually looks for it, and does nothing to change the actual armor model.

The world of LotRO is gorgeous never said otherwise, the High Def textures make it even more so. As with Rose (by the by I just started playing Titan Quest myself...rather fun :D ) my problem has been the awkward characters and animations. Turbine apparently learned nothing from DDO where they had the exact same problem (though I do think they did a great job on the Warforged visuals) with normal humanoid PC&#039;s. There is a disturbing similarity in visuals, and they all look &quot;dead&quot;. As much an issue as I have with WoW&#039;s lack of character diversity, not once did I ever think a human looked like an elf, or a gnome/halfling like a dwarf without a beard. I also never got the feeling that I was looking in to a the face of a fresh corpse with dead eyes and slack features. 

I get ALL those negative things when I look at LotRO player characters.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Looking at those screenshots, notice one important thing... the building, landscape and clothes essentially got &quot;less blurry&quot;, but the character themselves remained largely unchanged.  The ears did get more refined, but if the character was human instead of elf, would you notice?  The skin gained no more skin texture, and in my opinion actually looks worse at the highest resolution because now its clear that item and object textures far exceed the quality of the face textures.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I did play LOTRO and found the graphics gorgeous -- except for the character models and animations, that is.  However, I&#039;m not going to fall for the LOTRO hype, because I&#039;ve seen it before and know it for what it is.  It will certainly be more popular than DDO, Vanguard and possibly even more than COH/COV, due to its casual-friendliness.  

Single player instances remind me strongly of COH/COV and what DDO has begun to implement, for example.  But it has nothing to hook a so-called &quot;powergamer&quot; who has an average of 30+ hours of play time per week, and wants to fill them all with gaming goodness.  Right now I spend at least 40 hours a week playing a single player game, TitanQuest, which is more fun than any MMO I played in the past year.  That&#039;s somewhat backwards, until you think about how long people played Diablo II...

Personally the games on my watch list are Age of Conan, Warhammer, and Aion.   Soul of the Ultimate Nation is also there, but it&#039;s supposed to be a free to play game, so I&#039;m probably going to play it regardless.  Graphically speaking, the best will be Aion hands down.  The men will be big and bulky, the women will be lithe and pretty, and you can&#039;t beat real wings that come out of your character&#039;s back.  How&#039;s that flying epic mount?  Can&#039;t fight from it?  Too bad.  I can&#039;t wait to try out fighting in the air and casting pew pew spells in the sky.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Exactly Foton, even with High Res textures the base model is just a fugly lil andro who happens to have really really smooth skin.

And higher textures still doesn&#039;t account for the way too bulky looking armor. Instead of looking like plain old blankets wrapped around someone, with higher textures they look like patterened blankets wrapped around someone.]]></description>
