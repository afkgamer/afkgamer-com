					<description><![CDATA[Whew, I&#039;m glad to know that I&#039;m not the only one who was pushing for the title and already lost it.  In the early BETA I got it on all my toons and wondered and the noobness of those that didnt get it.  This time I realized a bit too late that my chosen class had been &quot;balanced&quot; and no longer operating on God-mode when I rushed the same three Blackwould I&#039;d done countless times before but this time, oops, I ended up dead!  I was shocked and pissed.  I thought about starting over so I could garner my title then figured, screw that.  I&#039;ll get it on my alt.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Those titles are just a measure of who goes the longest without crashing in a bad spot.

I made it to 15 a couple times sans death, but with the cap in place it&#039;s just a matter of time until you buy the farm if you&#039;re mining around mobs 5+ levels above you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you want pictures clean of the fellowship, head to Rivendell now before it gets jammed packed.  Last night I got my picture taken with Gandalf and Elrond, Sam, Pippin, Merry, Boromir, and Aragorn.

I couldn&#039;t find Legolas and Gimli, I&#039;m guessing they were out getting their records straight before 10 million teenage boys steal any feasible combination of their names...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My sympathies!  Both the avatars who have made it to 10 thus far lost their chance at The Undefeated due to bad pulls; of my three remaining, one didn&#039;t even manage The Wary, so I suspect I shall not be finding out if there are successors to Undefeated.   My husband actually threatened to reroll after our untimely deaths, but so far neither of us have succumbed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lost the Undefeated title line?  How did ya do it?  Personally, I lost it by falling to my death.  I knew there was a limit to how high you could fall without dying.  I fought my way through waves of goblins to get to the top of Axe Head Path.  Once there, I looked down at the respawn and said &quot;Screw That&quot;.  In my laziness, I took a dive off the cliff and, to my horror, splattered on the side of it.  BTW, water in this game DOES NOT break your fall.  It&#039;s as hard as concrete.  Maybe Middle Earth needs some water softeners added to its lakes and streams or maybe cliff diving into a pool of water is only for the HARDCORE.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Foton the defeated? Hrhr, welcome to the club. 

I had 3 chars and never got that title. Guess what? All three times were a stupid wipe of a pug caused by a rather retarted one in this freakin goblin castle in the very south of Thorins...
