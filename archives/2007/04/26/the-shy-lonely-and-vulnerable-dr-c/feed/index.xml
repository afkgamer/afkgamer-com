					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;I can&#039;t tell you how sick I am of guildmates making serious accusations against guildmates, then refusing to name the offenders cuz that&#039;s being a tattletale. Jesus, man up and point your finger, otherwise don&#039;t bother me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
ffs, i know exactly what you mean. so frustrating. makes matters worse when it&#039;s another fricking officer doing it. ugh.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Holy crap.  Do you guys have a psychological screening when you recruit people into your guild? Because it looks like you&#039;re only picking the freaky people. Nonetheless,  awesome story. I require more!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I switched to an RP server recently and rolled a BE pally, and the guild I&#039;m in are mostly RL friends and coworkers. If there&#039;s any guild drama, I hope they bring it to work. That&#039;d be really entertaining. ;) I really want to punish them for asking me to move to a fucking RP server. Any ideas?

On topic... Funny how some people just play drama-queen when the shit hits the fan. Dr. C just didn&#039;t want to own up to what he&#039;d done. That makes him a pussy and coward in my book.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was really looking forward to this story (Part III), thinkin&#039; there was gonna be some spectacular climax with BabbleOn. Although I&#039;m kinda disappointed, I guess its for the better that you have less drama to deal with. Less QQ is always a good thing.

Oh and I&#039;m a frequent reader. Keep up the awesome posts. ; )]]></description>
