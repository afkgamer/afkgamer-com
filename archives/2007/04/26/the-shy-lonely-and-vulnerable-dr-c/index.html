	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Meanwhile, back in World of Warcraft &#8230;</p>
<p>So, I think we can all agree that I&#8217;m guilded with a bunch of nitwits.  The following is further evidence.</p>
<p>Few weeks back, one of the guildmates /tells me in game that I might want to check out the security on our guild message boards because one of our former guild members apparently has full access to the private guild areas.  (Recall that I was volunteered to administer our guild &#8220;web presence&#8221; as no one else was willing to take that thankless job.)</p>
<p>This was me:  How?</p>
<p>Him:  Looks like they&#8217;re using a current member&#8217;s login info.</p>
<p>Me:  Who is using whose login?</p>
<p>Him:  I don&#8217;t wanna say.</p>
<p>Me:  Then what do we have to talk about?  </p>
<p>I can&#8217;t tell you how sick I am of guildmates making serious accusations against guildmates, then refusing to name the offenders cuz that&#8217;s being a tattletale.  Jesus, man up and point your finger, otherwise don&#8217;t bother me.</p>
<p>We danced around for a few days, with me promising anonymity and him playing hard to get, until finally he emails some screenshots of the private boards with the identifying information NOT redacted.  F&#8217;ing finally.</p>
<p>Because I&#8217;m well aware of Photoshop magic, I went to the server logs to snoop around a bit and get the goods on the guildmate who was playing fast and loose with our access and privacy.</p>
<p>The former guildmember:  BabbleOn  (she of previous drama:  <a href="https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/archives/2006/09/01/updates-or-how-the-stories-end/">Part I</a> and <a href="https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/archives/2006/09/08/razing-babbleon/">Part II</a>)  and the guildmate who shared his login info with her, for some UNKNOWN reason that I will never understand unless it involved sex and that&#8217;s an even scarier thought:  Med School Warlock, one of our frequent cyber-ors.  </p>
<p>Let me pause here to say:  Med School, my ass.  I think people going to med school have to &#8230; oh, I don&#8217;t know &#8230; LOG OUT every once in a while to go to class.  Aren&#8217;t there internships and residencies involved with many, many hours required?  They let that guy become a licensed physician and I&#8217;m staying the fuck out of his state for the rest of my life.  </p>
<p>He&#8217;s so full of shit, I can&#8217;t believe anyone would buy his story, and yet, I know of three who have.  Hook.  Line.  Sinker.  </p>
<p>Obviously, I&#8217;m not a fan of Dr. Cyber.</p>
<p>So, I have the goods on the would-be doctor, I rat him out to the officers, and they decide to have a talk with him after the night&#8217;s raids.  (So you&#8217;ll understand the magnitude of the indiscretion here:  BabbleOn and the Dr. are not married in real life, or in game, they don&#8217;t live together, they&#8217;re not relatives, they&#8217;re not neighbors, I didn&#8217;t even know they were friends, or more, prior to this.)</p>
<p>Well, funny thing happened on the way to the interrogation room, Dr. Cyber took matters into his own hands and /gquit.  Man, I was disappointed.  I was hoping to see him squirm.  I love the squirm.  Alas and alack, no squirm in /gu chat.</p>
<p>All he said before the /gquit was something about disagreeing with the direction of the guild, (psst, that&#8217;s code for &#8220;I want more loot&#8221;), he /gquit, and then he joined the fourth Guild That Hates My Guild on the server &#8212; newly formed of about a dozen guildmates who also disagreed with the &#8220;direction of the guild&#8221;.  </p>
<p><span id="more-1450"></span>I was incredibly disappointed about missing out on the public squirm.  The way I saw it, that didn&#8217;t mean I couldn&#8217;t see some private squirming.  So I /told him something like, &#8220;Good luck with your new guild over there.  Saved us the trouble of booting your ass for giving out your forum login information to former guildmates.&#8221;</p>
<p>His response:  Huh?</p>
<p>Was I unclear in some way?  Was that not English?  </p>
<p>Him:  I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about.</p>
<p>Me:  I heard you gave out your forum login info to *BabbleOn*.</p>
<p>Him:  You shouldn&#8217;t believe everything you hear.</p>
<p>Me:  I know, that&#8217;s why I checked the server logs.  (Oh snap!)</p>
<p>Now the conversation can be over at this point &#8212; I got my pound of flesh, I got to see a little squirming, I&#8217;m done.  We can move on now.  BUT NOOOO.  Dr. C thought he could outflank me.  He complained to his small group of &#8220;fans&#8221; still in the guild that I was being a prick about things, and one of his &#8220;friends&#8221; gets in my face about it in Ventrilo.  </p>
<p>How fucking dare I??  (Oh, I fucking dare.)  What&#8217;s my f&#8217;ing problem?  (I have one less problem now.)  That was so over the line, uncalled for!  (Me?  or him?) </p>
<p>And even though the one guy was literally screaming at me, I calmly explained, privately, what Dr. C had done and how I knew this to be truth, not just rumor and speculation, and I read back exactly what I had typed so there would be no misunderstanding.  </p>
<p>This is how much of a nitwit I am, I thought that would stop the screaming.  </p>
<p>Back in the public Ventrilo channel, the &#8220;friend&#8221; continued to insist that I apologize to Dr. Cyber, and a few other &#8220;friends&#8221; joined in, also demanding this apology that will never happen.  Publically, all I would say was that Dr. C had made an error in judgment, I had called him on it, end of story.  </p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t need to scorch the earth, I had my pound of flesh.  This additional squirming was really unnecessary, but was entertaining nonetheless.</p>
<p>The next day, they were STILL screaming at me, textually &#8212; this time on our message boards.  I treated their &#8220;friend&#8221; badly, what an asshole I am, bla bla.  </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I thought:  what a fucking crybaby.  Here&#8217;s what I wrote:  Dr. C made an error in judgment, I called him on it, end of story.</p>
<p>This is what I think now:  That sonuvabitch must be running some kind of cyber VOODOO to inspire that kind of loyalty.  Or, he&#8217;s telling some pretty tall tales to his inner circle.  (Well, same thing.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll bet he&#8217;s doing the &#8220;I&#8217;m so shy and lonely in real life&#8221; spiel.  </p>
<p>UNLESS.  </p>
<p>Unlesssss.  Unless he&#8217;s working a &#8220;I&#8217;m so shy and lonely and VULNERABLE in real life&#8221; routine.  Throw in a thing or two about his (imaginary) fiance of two years cheating on him &#8230; right before med school graduation &#8230; and here&#8217;s a pic of him next to his (mom&#8217;s) Corvette, and suddenly, he&#8217;s got himself a harem.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ll explain to you, just as I explained to his minions:  When you give me your righteous indignation act, you really ought to be RIGHT before you get indignant.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>I was really looking forward to this story (Part III), thinkin&#8217; there was gonna be some spectacular climax with BabbleOn. Although I&#8217;m kinda disappointed, I guess its for the better that you have less drama to deal with. Less QQ is always a good thing.</p>
<p>Oh and I&#8217;m a frequent reader. Keep up the awesome posts. ; )</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>reading these stories makes me want to join a PvE based guild, just to see if the same amount of drama goes on&#8230;then i remember that i&#8217;d end up being thrown into it as well, so i&#8217;ll stick to watching from the nosebleeds.  front row seats will get some of that shit from the fan dontchaknow 🙁</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>I switched to an RP server recently and rolled a BE pally, and the guild I&#8217;m in are mostly RL friends and coworkers. If there&#8217;s any guild drama, I hope they bring it to work. That&#8217;d be really entertaining. 😉 I really want to punish them for asking me to move to a fucking RP server. Any ideas?</p>
<p>On topic&#8230; Funny how some people just play drama-queen when the shit hits the fan. Dr. C just didn&#8217;t want to own up to what he&#8217;d done. That makes him a pussy and coward in my book.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Holy crap.  Do you guys have a psychological screening when you recruit people into your guild? Because it looks like you&#8217;re only picking the freaky people. Nonetheless,  awesome story. I require more!</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><blockquote><p>I can&#8217;t tell you how sick I am of guildmates making serious accusations against guildmates, then refusing to name the offenders cuz that&#8217;s being a tattletale.
