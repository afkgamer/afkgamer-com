					<description><![CDATA[Nordee,

I know!  I know!  My love is doomed.  Think I realized that even then.  The rest of my WoW love letter:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...

You must know it&#039;s doomed between us. You know this can&#039;t last. Nerfs will divide us. Server restarts will try my patience. I will tire of your NPC prattle; MY GOD, how much social interaction can one man fake take? Leveling you will become a chore.

I will call you &quot;out of touch&quot;¬ù. I may call you The New Nexus of Evil. I may even cite your past (ahem) indiscretions in player relations. You will label me &quot;demanding&quot;, &quot;unreasonable&quot;¬ù even. I&#039;m a cheat, a liar, a thief, you will say.

I&#039;ve been down this road before with other loves. At most, it was three, I swear to you.

O GOD, it was at least two DOZEN. But they meant nothing to me! I&#039;ve never felt this way before (since a year ago).

We&#039;re doomed. But right now, let&#039;s enjoy the moment. I will never love you like this again.

Your servant,
Foton &lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Dear World of Warcraft,

I will never love you more than I do right now, this moment, when I&#039;m still a noob -- marveling at your newness, enjoying your not-EQness, thinking you&#039;re wonderful in every way. I sprint off to complete your dumass quests with a skip in my step; I cheerfully interact with every NPC; I play with all your options, tenderly, never too harsh with the textures, my love. 

Foton, November 8th, 2004&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Those who do not learn from history are doomed....

...eh, why do I bother.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;well the most usefull items are the ones that help you get a head start, and I think that was their intent. Not to be a item you will use all the way to fifty?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

yeah but it would be nice if you had something to show in game that lasted for a bit more than say 4 hours (max) of play time :P]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m having quite the opposite reaction.  LoTRO is leaving me completely flat.  I was really enjoying the story arc instances, but then I started getting hit with kill-ten-wolves, a spider dungeon with ridiculous camera and aggro management issues, and a crafting system that seems, on the tiny bit of the surface I&#039;ve scratched, more tedious than deep.  I&#039;ll be into the music system when I can defeat raid bosses by playing dueling banjos with them.

I think I might be burned out on MMOs altogether.  In any case, no preorder for me, as vacation plans have me spending all of May away from the gaming PC.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Shame that Ettinmoors is all that the end game offers ... as in no raiding as yet, which im not sure is a good or bad thing.

I had chance to get to near-end game (mid 40&#039;s) on my beta character, and ettinmoors monster pvp thing is highly overrated in my opinion but as you need to level your character to progress in there as appossed to everyone getting access to a monster at lvl 15, beta was full of 30-40 vs a group of us... not fun, but that will change in time I suppose.  As for the founders thing being usefull, well the most usefull items are the ones that help you get a head start, and I think that was their intent.  Not to be a item you will use all the way to fifty?

Don&#039;t know what you were expecting really on that.]]></description>
