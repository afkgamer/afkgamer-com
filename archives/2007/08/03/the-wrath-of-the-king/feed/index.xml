					<description><![CDATA[At the Blizz Con Raid and Dungeons Panel, Jeff Kaplan hinted at &quot;Naxxramas revisited at Molten Core Level of difficulty for raiders, it would fit in perfectly given Northrend, don&#039;t you think?&quot;  in response to a question about everyone getting to see all the content eventually.  So, maybe, at least they&#039;re trying.

					<description><![CDATA[I like it - mostly because I enjoy leveling up, having a new class to play (and a very cool one) sounds fun, and frankly speaking...I never even got to fight Nef, let alone do Naxx. I&#039;m not hugely bothered by missing out on raid content, when faced with the prospect of more gameplay. I enjoy raiding, but I also like the solo game.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is it bad that I&#039;m happy my poor night elf can get a less homosexual dance and finally get rid of that goofy pony tail thing?

I&#039;m still unsure how inscription will make sense. I&#039;m just having difficulty imagining what the gathering profession would be or the mechanics of it. Being able to add extra damage, less threat, shorter cast times, etc. it just seems extremely difficult to balance.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A few points that ping in my mind:

- they have yet to announce a release date.

- that was an in-game movie, so while the areas might be sketched out I doubt they are even close to creating ALL the hero classes. There would need to be vaible options for most of the play style roles in the game.

- my hunch is to target a realse close to a huge holiday. End of the year seems too close to me; which stinks like may/june at least.

- new professions, class, and gear, means new graphics, and that takes ages.

- I love leveling as much as raiding, so getting to 80 will be good. BC had plenty of content for everyone to get to 70, which is a step in the right direction.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Acid

Read the faq. That&#039;s not how they are planned ot work at all. 

According to the Blizzard FAQ, You level your main to 80 you then do a quest that unlocks a Hero Class (the DK being the only option at this point for ALL classes) which you then roll and it will start at either level 60 or 70. You then have to turn around and level it to 80.

The way you describe it is the way it SHOULD work, but thats not the way it is.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[oh it seems we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; getting more talents.

The WoW devteam must be a stressful place. I also read they have a team reworking the 1-60 part (tutorial) of the game. That, and working on balancing the current contant, and another team working on the 51-point talent trees coming up. Makes for a good example on the hardships of large scale software design really.]]></description>
