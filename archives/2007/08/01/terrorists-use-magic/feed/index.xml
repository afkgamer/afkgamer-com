					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;you might intentionally be messing with my head as well&lt;/blockquote&gt;

My work here is done.

Yes, it is opposite the norm because I think the norm is stupid.  But the norm is what it is and I&#039;ll change it back.  I&#039;m sure you&#039;re not the only one who noticed I was flauting blog-eity&#039;s conventions and experimenting with the time/space continuum.

UPDATE:  Finished navigation changes.  Older entries, older post will always be the left-clicky and newer entries/post always the right clicky.  Anyone else looking to customize their WP navigation, good discussion on &lt;a href=&quot;http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/posts_nav_link&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the codex&lt;/a&gt;, esp. Kubrick Theme Format. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Futon, 

Love the blog, been reading it for months.  Just a quick nit pick at the new layout, I keep finding myself clicking the button I think will take me to the next page in chronological order and finding that I have instead gone back a post. Maybe its just me, but it seems your buttons are opposite the norm... the right button takes you back not forward.  Maybe its just me or my browser (IE at work :( ), but I think it is the way it is designed.  Guess you might intentionally be messing with my head as well :)

Awesome blog,
Kos]]></description>
