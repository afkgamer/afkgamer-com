					<description><![CDATA[What about that trinket that gives you a 30 minute illusion from the opposing faction?  I have one in the bank but only so much bag space and I need my mana regen fish (i.e. crack).  That being said, I bust it out after a couple beers and pretend I&#039;m impressing girls in Shattrath as a gnome.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dragon&#039;s Call.

I&#039;ll be damned if I didn&#039;t run the Sunken Temple hundreds of times and never saw this thing drop once.  A friend of mine got it on her second run (::grumble::).  I still go in there every once in a while, with my level 70, in the hopes that Eranikus will finally give me this thing and I can quit that instance forever.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I disagree with a lot of those.   It shouldn&#039;t be the &#039;Biggest Weapons of WoW&#039; but rather the most recognizable and &#039;iconic.&#039;  I like Hand of Rag, Thunderfury, Nemesis, Arcanite Reaper.  The rest are just meh.


I would have added Azuresong Mageblade, Staff of Dominance, Cenarion Helm, Stormrage Helm, Any full T0 set pre-MC.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s rather silly that 9 of the 10 top items are weapons.  I should think Savory Deviate Delight or the ninja/pirate costumes it bestows should be on there.  

As far as weapons go, the Cruel Barb is far more iconic than half the weapons on there.  There were probably far more /gquits and far more whining over that one weapon than any of the others on the list put together.]]></description>

Nothing says icon like Ravager&#039;s Woolies.  Do you know of another pair of ass-less chaps in the game?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rhok was (early on when MC was still hard) really a status symbol for hunters.  For the most part you had to be sort of good at life to be able to get it.  You had to be in a raid to get the leaf and the sinew, but from there it was mostly all you.  

The demons could be done by another hunter that had completed the quests, but that was cheating.  

If you had Rhok, you were kind of a bad ass, since it wasn&#039;t just a drop, and much more difficult to get than Bene/Ana.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We only had 1 Asscandy drop as well, where people said perds were rare drops, we had 2 times where we had dual perdition blades drop at once.

&lt;blockquote&gt;that damn Piccolo of the Flaming Fire is not iconic. It&#039;s moronic.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lol, so true.  I used to kicked people from the raids just for using that crap.]]></description>
