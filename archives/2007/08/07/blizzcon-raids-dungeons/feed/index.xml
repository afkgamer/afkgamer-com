					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;asier just to buy an account off some auction site. Hell, in most guilds people are leaving the game all the time and donate their account to guild or to whichever guildmate wants their old character.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Which is why Blizzard probally still hasnt noticed that anyone has a problem with anything they are doing which would cause them to quit.  They might be quitting, but their accounts stay active.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Same here.  Alt rep grinding = no way.

While I&#039;m thinking on similar topic, would you ever try to talk a friend into checking out WoW -- with max level at 80 and the rep grinds they&#039;d need and the resist gear to collect and ... everything.  That&#039;s another no way.  

Easier just to buy an account off some auction site.  Hell, in most guilds people are leaving the game all the time and donate their account to guild or to whichever guildmate wants their old character.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If they combined account attunements with, say, account reputation...I might come back.  Part of why I quit was I was fed up with my 70 shaman being a healbot, and I loved playing my warlock (64) but when I thought about doing all the same rep grinds on my &#039;lock that I did with my shaman...that was when I said screw it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the compliment. 

As a writer it&#039;s nice to see that people actually enjoy reading the things that I say, as opposed to only the things I manage to get other people to say.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Well, another ten levels of content, that&#039;s non-raider.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lol. Most games these days give out 10 levels of content for free while Blizz tends to charge the price of nearly a full game for their expansions. I can get through 10 levels of content pretty quickly, and I&#039;m not a hard-core gamer. I can&#039;t imagine paying full box price if that&#039;s the majority of what there is in the expansion for me to make use of. And while I&#039;m sure new dances and hairstyles are nice and all, that&#039;s maybe five to ten minutes of entertainment right there. I have a limited budget---if it&#039;s going to come down to paying for another 10 levels of the same kinds of quests and monsters, or something new and different like Pirates of the Burning Sea, I know where my money&#039;s going.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Worth buying if you&#039;re not a raider?  Well, another ten levels of content, that&#039;s non-raider. Read the forums, and you&#039;d think raising the level cap is ANTI-raider.

Actually, when I mentioned new dances and changing character appearance, that sold my gf on the expansion right then.  (I seriously doubt she&#039;ll hit the level cap beforehand, she didn&#039;t hit the old cap until after BC came out.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lol! Too, too funny. I&#039;m about *this close* to cancelling my sub. *sigh* But I probably won&#039;t, since one of the main folks I used to play WoW with is returning from Afghanistan at the end of the month. I think he&#039;s planning on playing WoW less when he gets back (but more tabletop gaming--whooo!), though, so we&#039;ll see how long I bother to stick in there. Sure, the new expansion sounds kinda interesting, but worth the full price if you aren&#039;t a raider? I&#039;m thinking... no.]]></description>
