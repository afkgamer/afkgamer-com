					<description><![CDATA[The reason they&#039;re concerned is because you can exploit (if you have enough gold) the current arena system. 5 guys can disband and reform a team on a weekly basis, lose every single game maybe even win a couple and they&#039;ll get decent points, around 400. I don&#039;t think this is very efficient personally, but essentially you&#039;re zeroing out your arena rating at 1500 every week. With that people were going in and 5-6 weeks later walking out with Merc Shankers and other arena weapons.

The idea seems like they want people to get the arena gear with the purpose of doing better in arena, not doing better in raids.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Acid,
yes the S1 arena gear is still available, and they made it cheaper than it was originally.  Arena&#039;s are tailor made for casuals - you can get away with as little as half an hour a week.  You can lose repeatedly and STILL get points.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Noob question alert.

Is it still possible to obtain S1 arena gear with S2 out?  Heck more importantly, is it possible for a casual gamer to play in the arena and get any kind of gear at all? =\  freakin blizzards just driving me closer and closer to AoC with every announcement =(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[holy crap
they finally got a nice difference between arena and raid gear where you HAD to do arenas to get good resilience gear, and you HAD to raid to get good gear for raiding. Finally they had some balance where raiders no longer ruled the BGs. (Weapons may cross over but they could just redesign them a little.)

But now, it sounds like they want to lower the quality of pvp gear? To satisfy raiders?

This is why I quit. It&#039;s a &quot;raid or die&quot; game. I thought they were starting to at least try to change, I guess I was wrong.]]></description>
