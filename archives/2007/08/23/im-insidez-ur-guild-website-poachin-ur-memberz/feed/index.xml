					<description><![CDATA[Seriously, is poaching that much of a problem?? 

Maybe its my guild; a day-one guild with a good number of people that have been raiding for a long time.. Maybe its the environment; most people do get along, and when they don&#039;t the management work hard to smooth out the wrinkles where they can..  Ours (IMO) is a steady guild, not immune to poaching, but fairly resistant to it..

Granted, we&#039;ve had our fair share of drama.. We&#039;ve lost people because we weren&#039;t &quot;hardcore enough&quot; (those people no longer play, imagine that).. We&#039;ve lost people to drama.. We&#039;ve lost people because we&#039;re too hardcore.. We&#039;ve lost people due to attrition (40-man vs 25 man) and we&#039;ve lost people to RL.. 

But the majority of our player base is fairly constant.. We have fun more often than not, and that is probably what makes us &quot;poaching&quot; resistant.. If someone wants to leave for better or greener pastures, let &#039;em; there&#039;s always people in the wings that are there to take their place..  

But the environment has more to do with resisting &quot;poaching&quot; than hiding DKP or attendance..  If they&#039;re succeptable to &quot;poaching&quot; hiding DKP isn&#039;t gonna slow that down much..

I suppose if you see the raiding game as competition this can be more of an issue..]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t forget the possibilities that the Armory opens for poaching...

Hey look, OtherGuild#4 has 7 level 70 mages and only 3 of them have SSC gear...

Don&#039;t we need a mage?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i love our site. we have a front page, an active message board (with room for the general public to post, as well as a members area), and dkp.

i disagree that you should lock up the recruiting board. not all guilds use a forum to recruit people, but those who do - and leave them out for public consumption - make me happy. i have a list of &quot;rival&quot; guilds&#039; recruiting boards that i check regularly. i see who is out there looking for a guild (potential recruits!), i see if any of my members are scouting other guilds, and if someone applies to our guild i can see if they have applied elsewhere and gather any extra info that they filled out in other guilds&#039; app templates.

our dkp isn&#039;t locked up either. sometimes people who aren&#039;t in or are no longer in the guild have earned dkp with us. i don&#039;t want to keep them from being able to see it, nor do i want to employ some complicated pw system where i have to keep track of who has/doesn&#039;t have access. 
we never raid with more than one or two non-guildies (if any), so your scenario doesn&#039;t apply. i can&#039;t really think of any reason to hide our dkp from the public. i mean, who really cares?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a good point about Rival guilds checking out each other&#039;s sites for signs of drama to start trying to poach each other&#039;s top DPSers, tanks, healers etc.

I&#039;ve gotta get our guild to lock down some of our site, I definitly don&#039;t want our Guildwhohatesyourguild (Yes! We have one too...) trying to snag our precious priestys.]]></description>
