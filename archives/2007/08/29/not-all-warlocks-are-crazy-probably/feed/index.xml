					<description><![CDATA[Its a fucking game people, someone saying they want to PUG your wife isn&#039;t offensive, and if you take it to be that way then obviously you and your wife have some issues, like maybe you too busy raiding to fuck her every once in a while.  if you gkick someone for saying they want to pug your wife you might as well stick a sign in your head that says &quot;I am insecure&quot;.

that&#039;s all
and if you agree that someone joking around saying they want to pug some jackass&#039; wife is cause for a kick, you&#039;re just as fucking stupid]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Comments between friends/mates are usually not taken as insulting&lt;/i&gt;
there is a big difference between a little kid in your guild saying &quot;your wife is a milf I want to pug her&quot; and your buddy you go drinking with saying &quot;dude your wife is hot!&quot;

But even then I think said buddy would not say &quot;I want to PUG your wife&quot; that would probably get a punch.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Comments between friends/mates are usually not taken as insulting, even when of a personal nature. This is true both in RL and in WoW.

Reading a few more of the comments, it seems as if at least on the surface, the sentence itself was not meant to be insulting, see posts 20-22 by a Rogue belonging to the said guild.
Also from that Rogue, he seems to support the other statements by the Warlock. So while the Warlock may have gone over the edge with his later comments, it seems the guild he was talking about is not as pure as its other members make it out to be...]]></description>
