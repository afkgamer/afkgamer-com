		<p>Ding dong, Serpentshrine and Tempest Keep (World of Warcraft) attunements are dead!  </p>
<p>Read:  <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=110637185&#038;sid=1">Serpentshrine and TK Attunements Lifted</a>.  </p>
<p>Tigole wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>After a lot of thought and deliberation, we&#8217;ve decided to remove the attunement requirements to enter Serpentshrine Cavern and Tempest Keep: The Eye. While many of our attunements in the Burning Crusade have been good progression checks, a few of the attunements have turned out to cause unnecessary stress on guilds either doing the content or attempting to do the content. With Black Temple and Battle for Mount Hyjal thriving, we want to encourage (rather than prevent) new guilds and raid groups to attempt Serpentshrine and TK. We are going to leave the current attunement quests in the game so that players can still engage in the challenge and the lore of those quests should they choose to. At a later point, we are considering adding a final reward step to those quests as well (that way those who have already completed them would not miss out on a *new* reward).</p>
<p>We&#8217;re listening to feedback from you guys constantly and your opinions are important to us. We want this game to be the best possible MMO experience for our players.</p>
<p>Enjoy Serpentshrine and Tempest Keep =)</p>
<p>(Please note: This change will go live later today &#8212; it&#8217;s not yet active)</p></blockquote>
<p>You may attempt to revive your guilds now.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>meh all these changes have basically come too late for my guild. We were a &#8220;casual raiding&#8221; guild that had cleared up through BWl and was just starting Naxx when TBC came out. Prior to that we had a change in guild leadership and a person took over who chose to go the hardcore route. This was probably the only way to really get anywhere in TBC raid zones but it was NOT a good fit for the guild. We recently had a guild meltdown (if only I hada Blog I could be the next Foton 😀 ) due to the guild essentially rebelling against the hardcore types. </p>
<p>Kara was released too hard&#8230;now that it&#8217;s at an &#8220;entry level difficulty&#8221; as it should be my guild has burned down to a handful of people. Rebuilding just sucks basically.</p>
<p>As for Tigole&#8217;s comments</p>
<p>&#8220;a few of the attunements have turned out to cause unnecessary stress on guilds either doing the content or attempting to do the content.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well no fucking duh you dumbass. Sending people all over Outlands, and grinding the same instances for the same crappy reputation rewards for days/weeks on end burns people out, whodafuckinthunkit.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>uh huh, I said it from the damn start.  It&#8217;s what was a weak part of the game in EQ.  Attunements and keying made getting new people up to the requirements for guilds a right pain. Furor really dropped the ball on that whole heroic&gt;key&gt;attunement bs really, even after his rants about keying and attunements within the PoP era 🙂</p>
<p>But Random, our guild was pretty much like yours &#8230; we had cleared to twins in aq40 and cleared spiderwing in naxx as TBC come out.  We weren&#8217;t hardcore we raided 3 hours and 4 days a week.  But Kara was far from hard for us and cracking Grull/Mulgard post nerf patch was quite quickly done, and after a few days on Magtheridon after the nerf and he was on farm.</p>
<p>The only stumbling block was having to drag everyone through Karazhan and Gruul&#8217;s lair to progress which would have taken us months (and did for SSC which we are still struggling on the first boss :P)  the requirements for Tempest Keep was just stupid imo.  But gotta feel sorry for half my guild who have 75%-100% of the quests done for it now it&#8217;s basically all pointless.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>our guild split too. never really considered the fact that the split was caused by game content. oh well, those who wanted to focus on raiding joined me in a guild created for that purpose, and those who didn&#8217;t&#8230; didn&#8217;t. we&#8217;re all still friends for the most part. no huge drama on my guild&#8217;s end. </p>
<p>kinda wish they wouldn&#8217;t go changing the game in the middle though. it feels like any accomplishments achieved after such nerfs will be forever asterisked.</p>

<p>Hmmm&#8230; maybe all those reports regarding falling player activity and declining subscription numbers might be true.</p>
<p>I would say the next step is Karazhan raid cap raised to 15 players.  ML, SSC and TK raid caps upped to 30? 35? 40?</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>I&#8217;m glad they changed it. Am only sorry it came a bit too late for some guilds. What I totally disliked about it the attunements for SSC and TK was the division it created. Had two camps, ones that had all their, and the ones that didn&#8217;t. That in itsself isn&#8217;t so bad had the classes in my guild been more evenly spread across both camps, but they weren&#8217;t. Still needed the &#8220;haves&#8221; to help the &#8220;have nots&#8221; but the &#8220;haves&#8221; were getting so sick of the continuous rep grinds etc that it became termed hand-holding. It wasn&#8217;t hand-holding at all though.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s over. Maybe at least some guilds that managed to hang on this long will be spared.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Our guild&#8217;s still working on getting people geared up enough to progress on to those two places, but not having to harp on everyone to get attuned/keyed will definitely be nice, when the time comes. Still have to make the connection with Gruul, though &#8211; 5% is our latest record, we&#8217;re almost there. Helps that they nerfed his HP. Would help more if cave-ins wouldn&#8217;t follow me around wherever I go to hide.</p>

<p>Part of ours was that our guild leader (the one responsible for leading us to this slow death) was a great Raid Leader prior to TBC who sucked at managing a guild. Part of the reason kara was &#8220;hard&#8221; was that everyone was starting to feel like it was work and that if we didn&#8217;t perform perfectly we would be &#8220;fired&#8221; This constant trying ot stay perfect had the effect of having us focus on OURSELVES more so than the entire raid and working as a team. It&#8217;s like the guy went crazy when he finally got the GM position and forgot how to be a raid leader.</p>
<p>All I can really say is that the game had lost all its &#8220;fun&#8221; due to the way he was trying to whip everyone in to a hardcore raider whether they wanted to be one or not. This caused quite a few of our more casual people to leave, and instead of addressing anything he kept it up for another couple of months and more left and when we FINALLY got together and the split happened there wasn&#8217;t enough of either side left to really keep the guild functioning. Now it limps along with maybe 10-15 consistent players (every day types)and about 20 others who are infrequent (once a week or less). I can&#8217;t bring myself to /gquit because i&#8217;ve been in the guild for around 2 yrs now (the only other one I have been in merged with this one about 1 month after I joined it) and it just sucks.</p>
<p>Ack that went on for longer than I intended.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>There is no casual raiding in WOW and Blizzard&#8217;s attempts to make it so, somehow made things much worse.  Everyone has to be on ther A game for every millisecond of the boss fights.  Having a bad day?  Have a kidding crying in the back ground?  Trying to tell the spouse you&#8217;ll be done in a few minutes?  Gotta pee?  Too bad.  If you aren&#8217;t paying attention for a fraction of a second your raid is going down.</p>
<p>They fixed the consumables to a degree but you still need to go in with a decent amount of potions, bandages and have repair money.  So raiding only 3 days a week turns into a 4th minimum of farming.  A 4-night commitment to anything isn&#8217;t casual.  Where is your &#8220;me&#8221; time &#8211; casual time?  Day 5 and day 6?  If you&#8217;re playing that much, you&#8217;re probably not casual.  Raid casual perhaps, but not WOW casual.</p>
<p>We need to face the ugly truth&#8230;there is no casual raiding in WOW.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>I personally think that Key questing is a very important part of the game. The fact it has been removed negates the idea that people can better themselves by sdpending a lot of time raiding.</p>
<p>I personally enjoyed the fact that I had to rep grind, and I had to complete relevant quests to do the dungeons.</p>
<p>As the dungenios increase in difficulty, as yuo clear each one you r characters improve to meet the diffculty levels of that particular dungein. Removing the key chain quests just means people with have half hearted attempts at the HIG END GAME dungeons to no avail.</p>
<p>So I actually think it was a bad idea. How is anyone expected to defeat archimonde if they have no chance of killing magtheridon, let alon Illidan.</p>
<p>A slight error I think, I beleive they should re-instate the key quests full time and ignore complaints of the quests chains</p>
