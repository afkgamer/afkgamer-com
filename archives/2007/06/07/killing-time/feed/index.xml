					<description><![CDATA[I saw Scott linked this as well, I was  going to comment on it then, but his blog system is fubar :P.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Modern technology and I aren&#039;t exactly the best of friends. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

How does this qualify someone to talk about the problem?  Anyway, I would prefer our government (Live in good &#039;ol blighty if you cared) would actually pay for consoles and pc&#039;s for the young folk around here.  They stay out till god knows what hour drinking and beating the crap out of cars.  Record numbers of ASBO&#039;s (kinda like a local restraining order for an area rather than people) being handed out to youngsters to keep away from neighborhoods/shops because they cause trouble and large amounts of general damage.

Give them a damn xbox or a Wii and shut them the hell up and keep em off the damn streets,  that Utopian view expressed in that article is long gone.... by a good 20 years.]]></description>

Lookee what I found! &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Oh... dear... lord.

Someone&#039;s trying to make you obsolete, Foton! But don&#039;t worry, they lack some of your delightfully acerbic wit.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When I was growing up we did play little league baseball, run around the park, and play in the streets. But we also used to throw rocks at each other, trip people and laugh at them as they fell, play pretend war, and a bunch of other very terrible things. 
The writer in the article paints a picture of like 1950&#039;s middle America, where people were more naive. 
Also, the writer is trying to pass off wikipidia as a credible source, bad journalist, bad.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve got a 7 year old daughter who loves gaming. We play WoW together (she likes to make a new character, get it to level 4 or 5, then make another new character). She has a DS Lite and plays Animal Crossing, Pokemon, and Sonic. She plays violin (had her recital last night), she draws and paints all the time, she cooks and bakes with me, we jump rope, play in the park, go swimming at the town pool, bike ride...

Gaming is just another part of growing up. ANYTHING is a problem if it&#039;s the only activity you participate in. And the killing part...it&#039;s a game. No different than cops and robbers, and no more real. 

You never hear about intelligent kids learning about the negative effects of violence through video games. You only hear about kids at the extremes who probably would have been violent with or without video games.]]></description>
