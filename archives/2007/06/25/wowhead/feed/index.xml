					<description><![CDATA[While I agree that rationalizing is silly, the reasoning for it is that Wowhead is a site with content built by its contributing audience. In particular, all of the people that were uncomfortable with IGE backing Thottbot and Allahkhazam had made Wowhead their home turf.  Any FUD and misdirection will keep that segment of their audience from rallying.

The more this goes on, the less people will care, more and more responses of &quot;it&#039;s just a game&quot; is exactly what they are going for with the rationalizations. They want to make it a tired issue.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, why rationalize? I&#039;d just post a note that said, &quot;paying off my mortgage; go find a new site.&quot; Screw the moral high ground.

This is kinda funny, though, given that all the people who used to direct me to wowhead kept stridently telling me that the whole reason it was better than any other database site was because it wasn&#039;t owned by gold sellers. I was like, I never click on the ads anyway, and if they start using ad servers that are known for spyware Trend Micro will warn me, so what does it matter which I use?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve stopped giving a damn.  When a site I visit regularly is bought up with RMT cash, I just put its ad server on my adblock list and go on using the content.

Develop a revenue stream off that, biotches.]]></description>
