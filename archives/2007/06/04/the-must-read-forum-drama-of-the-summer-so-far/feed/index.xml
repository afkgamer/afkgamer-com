Any clue what Joe Edmonds is talking about?

Warez? Home Networking? Online Gold? Renovations around the house?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This made my day!! I happened to run into Drama of Norgannon while working my quests for a Netherdrake. I came across him in the mines; where for no apparent reason, he started following me around. We were the only two souls there early in the morning.

First I thought he was a boy just looking for attention. I couldn&#039;t tell it was a female toon, since we all are wearing disguises. His motives became clear while clearing a path to a Nether Egg, dutifully impressing me with his ability to ninja the egg.

Needless to say I was a bit miffed and before getting some sleep I decided to see what Google had to say, which pointed me to here.

I am now going to bed with a smile on my face and feeling a bit sorry for him rather than muttering silent curses against him.]]></description>
