					<description><![CDATA[To Heather, re: grammar - In my defense, it was an IM conversation and other than to  condense the conversation, I left what we both said as it was from the text we both typed at the time.    I see your point though and I fixed it.  I even went back through what Foton said and capitalized his I&#039;s this time around. :P]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I take everything I said back. I just saw someone on the LFF channel asking, &quot;anyone for half-orc schemer, half ministral&quot;--presumably meant to say &quot;have minstrel.&quot;

There&#039;s a part of me dying to ask if &quot;ministral&quot; is some sort of cross between minestrone soup and a minstrel, and what it means when you have half of one.

I promise I don&#039;t normally play grammar/spelling cop. There are just times when it hits me, or when I see an unintentional play on words that I can&#039;t resist...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[(Goes off to read the interview.) Dangit, the writer in me is twitchy at the fact that someone who&#039;s conducting interviews has that kind of grammar and spelling. Once you&#039;ve had your work gone over by harsh editors, you can never read anything the same way again.

Huh, I think I just spent the entire afternoon farming (the kind with green onions, cauliflower, and hops) and cooking. In my defense, I was reading a review book at the same time so it wasn&#039;t as boring as it sounds.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;You played a cleric in everquest and a priest at some level in Wow, Right? Do you enjoy healing or is it for purely utilitarian reasons?

Foton: i hate it. but alas, i&#039;m a control freak and nobody can do it properly besides me
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the end that&#039;s pretty much why I stuck with my cleric in EQ too. So many twoboxers come in and are like, oh sure I can be in the chain, but one key person (tank, cleric, whatever) LDs and the box-clerics lose the thread completely, leaving the *real* clerics to pick up the slack.]]></description>
