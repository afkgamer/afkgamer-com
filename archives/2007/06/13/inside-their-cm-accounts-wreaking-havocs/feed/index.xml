					<description><![CDATA[Hhaha! Hugs it out? Did you get that from the office?!?!

If so.. that episode is hilarious..

My friend told me he thought it was weird seeing those posts.. and thought keyloggers were going to spread like wildfire... I honestly didn&#039;t believe him at first until I saw what happened!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow. Just wow. Ha, loved Eyeonix&#039;s enjoyment of banning them.

In unrelated news, the Evendim patch notes bowled me over. It took me about an hour to read them; seems like the fixes and new content are coming much faster and in greater quantity than they did with Warcraft if I&#039;m not imagining things. And Patience got kind of punchy in there. :)]]></description>
