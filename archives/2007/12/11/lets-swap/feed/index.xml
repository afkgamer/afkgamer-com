					<description><![CDATA[AV at Level 70

Hmm, Ive made a Ton of Honor in AV, and its normally done
this way.

If theres minimal horde def at galv, Ally take
galv, IB GY, IB &#038; TP Towers, Hut, FW Towers &#038; FW GY
and finally massive zerg on Drek.

The reason Ally can do this faster then the horde?

The Ally Bridge, is a massive advantage the horde dont
have, The horde advance stalls at the bridge just long
enough for Ally to be able to reach thier objective 
of zerging Drek first

Ally win 9 out of 10 fights that way.

Ive always got a 100 AV tokens, the extra sits in my mailbox,
which I spend on health pots, the rest I lose.

I make honour way faster in AV then any other BG.

In fact, id go as far as to say, Ally have it to easy in AV
as they win 9 out 10 fights]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been playing a lot of AV recently on my rogue.  People can cry about map imbalances all they want, but the way I&#039;ve been seeing it is much simpler.  Alliance seem to have no organization.  They just give us Stonehearth/Icewing while they zerg toward our D.  But even when they get to our defense there is no concentrated effort.  A few go to the tower, a few to the captain, and a few to the GY.  We held off the whole ally zerg with 6 guys in one AV 2 days ago. We killed the guys going for the IB flag.  (tip alliance, there&#039;s probably a rogue hidden among the defender NPCs at IB gy, if you ride through to pull off the guards, he will stunlock you and laugh at you as you die to the NPCs.)  All we did was use logical CC, healing, and used one guy as DPS assist on D.  We took out the 10 or so headed to flag.  Went over and cleaned out galv, then up the tower to clean out the guys that had went there.

TLDR version:  Stop trickling in to different attack points, mount a concentrated effort.  Stop letting us have a free cap on the first 2 bunkers, stonehearth, and belinda.  You just might win a few!

This is all coming from the Shadowburn BG group.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What people do not realize about current AV is that it can still offer the best honor/time ratio across all BGs, regardless if you win or lose.

If both sides destroy the four towers and kill galv/belinda, thats 5x62 +2x20, which is almost 350HP, guaranteed, regardless if u &quot;win&quot; or &quot;lose&quot;.

The above scenario, if noone defends, can finish in 10minutes.
Thats 35honor/minute.

I have been in BGs where horde defended, stopped the initial alliance rush, had the alliance rez back to SH, or even worse stormike keep. Of course they &quot;won&quot; the match, taking 600points, but the game lasted 30 to 40minutes.
Was that strategy better for them than the one I described above? No, since their honor gained/time ratio was less than 20honor/minute.

Even if alliance paladins suck, defending horde most frequently causes 35 alliance packed in stormpike base, and passing the bridge alone takes 15minutes.

I&#039;d love to see the day, when everyone realizes that, and both sides wait for all towers to be destroyed, and walk away with 350points in 10minutes, regardless who kills the enemy boss.

PS: I assume that people play AV to get honor-&#062; free epics.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m really not in favor of a map swap at this point.  Once Alliance realizes that the Horde base is no impediment to the General at all, they&#039;ll just AFK out of any match that comes up that way.

Seriously, if Alliance can&#039;t leave a few behind to guard the Bridge of Death, they sure as heck won&#039;t backup the blind NPCs that wander around the Horde base.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hate AV now with a passion.  Let&#039;s end the whole map argument and mirror them but skinned appropriately.  No reason not to do it, it would ensure equality just like WSG which is for the most part, mirrored. Put the same NPCS and bosses - exactly the same in the same positions - again reskin appropriately for each faction.

In my very generalized opinion, I think Alliance are: PVE oriented, wanna be heroes and probably younger in age so selected the pretty characters.  My kids and nephews are all alliance.  Anytime I see my nephews&#039; names show up in a BG i just shake my head.  I know they are busy having fun while ruining someone&#039;s BG. LOL

I hated EotS but now I play that almost exclusively.  AV is pretty much dead to me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Having played from a purely Alliance perspective:

The Alliance seem unwilling to defend Stonehearth Bunker/Icewing Bunker/Stonehearth Graveyard.  The whole mass rolls away towards Snowfall Graveyard, then down to Galv/Iceblood Tower/Iceblood Graveyard.  

By this time the horde have already tagged both towers and the graveyard, and Balinda falls soon after.  Once Horde are respawning at Stonehearth, there is no way for the Alliance offence to break through.  Alliance does not understand the importance of defending this critical chokepoint.  

If Snowfall was accessible via another route except Stonehearth, things would not change.  The Alliance simply does not want to defend.  They can&#039;t do it.  

Something needs to be done to break up the natural pathing tendency of the Alliance.  At the moment, the main offence of Horde and Alliance miss each other by mere seconds at Stonehearth Bunker.  What would happen if the terrain was changed ever so slighty to force these two trains to collide?]]></description>
