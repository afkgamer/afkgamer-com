					<description><![CDATA[Why do I attempt to spam a holiday message?  Am I so bereft of the holiday spirit that I try to derail good tidings for my own benefit?  Yes, yes I am, and beginning today, I&#039;m adopting a new attitude -- one without commercial gain as its sole focus.  It&#039;s a new me, and I have AFK Gamer to thank!!

(This spam-attempt may have been edited to suit the holiday season.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Foton still lives, and so does Raster - good! 

As I ground honor this weekend for the updated pvp trinket, (Thanks for that PvE encounter that needs a PvP trinket Blizzard! Our priests love you. :P) out of 10 games played on Sunday the Alliance won 6 times. Two of those were Drek kills. The other two were by reinforcements. And in one I was screamed at for taking a bunker. Hello screaming people, SH bunker and SHGY are not capped with the same flag.]]></description>
