					<description><![CDATA[At the beginning I was confident about Blizzard&#039;s behaviour with the work on the classes. I&#039;m one of those who do not really care about balance issues and do not contribute to long to infinite threads, exactly because it&#039;s something that keeps changing continuously. I think it&#039;s a good thing and I&#039;m worried when this stops, when noone tries new solutions anymore.

Till the point that made me write this:
http://www.cesspit.net/drupal/node/284

From my point of view the most powerful class (and same in many other games) is the priest. For the simple reason that they are always required, they can make the difference.

I just hope that Blizzard doesn&#039;t continue to remove the abilities that made their classes beautiful and unique. Like in the case of the warrior I tried to explain.]]></description>
