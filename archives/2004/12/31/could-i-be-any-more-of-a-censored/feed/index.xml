					<description><![CDATA[Actually something like this:
http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2003/12/the_longawaited.html

Mainly concerning the swearing, cause alot of ppl take offense at such things.

&lt;i&gt;Unless people start taking up bandwidth with too many &#039;Foton sucks&#039; comments. I&#039;d think 3 or 4 of those are sufficient to get the idea.&lt;/i&gt;
  Heh, in some sites even one comment like that would require an instant apology or bannination. I suppose playing MMORPGs tends to inure one to erm, overheated arguements.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;WTF is with these people? Do they have /invite macro&#039;d or some shit? I could still be typing /invite or right-click inviting the first guy, they&#039;ve already got their entire group assembled. Unbelievable.&quot;
  I make it a point of policy to only group with ppl that I have actually talked to first, those silent inviters are usually one of those uncommunicative pricks who runs off and does shit by themselves and expects everybody else to just follow along, like some kind of human controlled helper bots, or something. Fuck&#039;em.
  Have you ever noticed that you have no commenting guidelines?]]></description>
