					<description><![CDATA[I did use your patch link over on cesspit.net, after waiting over an hour for the WoW shittorrent server.  Left a comment thanking you, but must have got lost in moderation.

Blizzard has quite a swagger in their step lately.  Should be good fun when the fanbois start abandoning them, as they always do.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Took me two hours, twenty-two minutes, and forty-four seconds to download the patch.

My wife got done in an hour and a half.

I was rather ticked.  Not just because Blizzard can&#039;t seem to figure out that Bittorrent works better when you leave your leeches connected after the patch is complete, so they become seeders.  No, I was really, really ticked off because on a day of precious vacation time, dedicated to gaming, I was booted at 9am, and didn&#039;t get to play against until 4pm.

And then they had the gall to charge for tradeskill ranks.  I didn&#039;t see that anywhere in the patch notes.  It&#039;s just too bad I can&#039;t stand Sony any more, and I can&#039;t log into DAOC without feeling so tired and bored that want to go to bed early.

Bad Blizzard!  Bad!]]></description>
