					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll not deny that I&#039;m a moron; many times, I am.  But I don&#039;t do interviews, dude, and I&#039;m not a reporter.

I sometimes journalize my online MMOG experiences, and other times regurgitate news I find on the internets.  Other times still, I post drunkenly.

Was I rough on Lax in my commentary?  Ya, a little.  I think it&#039;s stupid to hook up with people you meet online.  Maybe others are running into a better class of people online than me.  Could happen.  

As far as me being a noobzorz twinkzorzed EQ player, I catassed with the rest of them.  In the end, it was easier to buy a different house than to clean the old one.

But thanks for playing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dude.  You sir, are a moron.   
No single person is &quot;wrong&quot; with online gaming.   
On the other hand, there are morons out there that work to degrade anything that is online gaming.  

You are nothing but a piece of shit reporter that wants so badly to be a part of something that he has to write-up a shitty intertview that is more than 100% biased.  Dood, just deal with the fact that you suck in real life and can&#039;t even handle a simple unbiased interview -- and to compile this -- you&#039;re also probably a very bad EQ player that can&#039;t get shit on his own and has a bunch of newbie characters (mebbe twinked omgz!!) -- step up to the mic kid.

You think you got what it takes to do anything?  

The microphone is right in front of you, punk.
