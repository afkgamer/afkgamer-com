		<p>Part IV, Example III of the week-long series on human refuse doing what they do best, this time in an online environment where all can see! After today&#8217;s tale of woe and teeth gnashing, there will be one more to tell (for now). What fun it&#8217;s been, selecting only the best (worst?) of the assholes to document.</p>
<p>No small coincidence that most of the depravity comes from EverQuest, possibly the same would be true of Ultima Online (I didn&#8217;t put a lot of time into UO ever) &#8212; my theory on this is because EQ requires such a horrific time commitment, that the line between reality and fantasy blurs for some. Not to say that these assholes wouldn&#8217;t be assholes otherwise; they undoubtedly would. But it may be that the immersiveness of this niche fuels the flame. <span class="fullpost"></p>
<p>Example III, however, comes from WAAAAY back. Back before there was an EverQuest, before there was an Ultima Online. I&#8217;m talking &#8217;bout back to my gaming roots, man!, in a little PVP shooter called Rolemaster: Magestorm, previously chronicled briefly, <a href="http://gamma-gaming.blogspot.com/2004/07/way-back-when.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Since this game was so damn fun (fading memory can do wonders for how highly I think of a game) and there really wasn&#8217;t many other online games around at the time, there was a core of Magestorm players that hung out together almost every night &#8230; playing on the same team, playing against each other, trash talking, arguing about character templates, bla bla &#8230; and we all became quite friendly and close.</p>
<p>Some of us closer than others, as it turned out.</p>
<p>The one weekend, one of the regulars announces, in a conspiratorial tone (shhh, tell no one), that one of the female regulars (let&#8217;s call her BangsEmAll, to protect her gaming identity) is taking a trip to visit one of the male regulars (let&#8217;s call him CouldDoBetter, to protect his gaming identity). Most of us found this very curious, for a few reasons:</p>
<p>1. Bangs was in the process of divorcing the father of her children. And good thing too, since he was extremely abusive to her! So she said, and we knew she wouldn&#8217;t say that if it wasn&#8217;t true. (For crissakes, I was young, I believed any sort of shit people would tell me), and</p>
<p>2. Before this point, we had never imagined that people, who knew OF each other only through an online game, would be interested in meeting each other in real life, for what nefarious purpose, we could only guess &#8230; and guess we did! (For crissakes, online society was new. Did I mention that I was young?)</p>
<p>The next week, Bangs came back from her road trip and wasn&#8217;t shy at all about telling us that she and CouldDoBetter did indeed have sexual relations, many times and in many places and that they intended to continue, probably in other places. Well woopeefuckingdoo for you. We needed to know all of that, why?</p>
<p>Eventually, Bangs and CouldDoBetter moved in together, dragging along the youngsters to enjoy their new home. I will give CouldDoBetter credit here, for taking in that hosebag&#8217;s children and, from what friends tell me, was a very positive influence in their lives. (emphasis on &#8220;was&#8221; &#8230; c&#8217;mon! you just know this hosebag is gonna fuck this up somehow, don&#8217;t you?)</p>
<p>Fast forward a bit, and Bangs gets her divorce from the father, we all continue to enjoy battling in Magestorm, and then the shitstorms start arriving. The first one is named Ultima Online and the second one is named EverQuest. Bangs starts playing Ultime Online and falls in roleplay love with another UO player, marries the roleplay fiance, and starts spending every waking hour with him, maybe on their roleplay farm, I dunno. CouldDoBetter is not happy with the situation, probably because he is NORMAL (after a fashion).</p>
<p>CouldDoBetter puts his foot down, roleplay or not, let&#8217;s get away from this situation and go play EverQuest. *waits for laughter to die down* Isn&#8217;t it fun when you just know how a story is going to end? Most of the Magestorm crew had also moved over to EQ, so for a time, we played together. But then, it became obvious to Bangs that the rest of us just weren&#8217;t as commited to &#8220;winning&#8221; EQ as she was. So she moved on to other guilds, and other EQ challenges, and other online fake boyfriends.</p>
<p>Which became a problem for CouldDoBetter when Bangs started taking weekend trips away from her precious EQ, and ignoring her children, and quitting her part-time job as a temp. Eventually, Bangs and CouldDoBetter parted ways, much like Bangs parted ways with her children when her ex was awarded custody. Bangs went to live with one of the fake EQ boyfriends and did marry this one (in real life this time). She even got a FULL TIME job, or so she said. (By this time, I was old enough to realize that she could say it even if it wasn&#8217;t true.)</p>
<p>She never lost that charming penchant for sharing every aspect of her life with anyone that would listen: her sexual preferences, masturbation techniques, what her genitals looked like at every single moment, and all the different ways that CouldDoBetter sucked and made her life a living hell.</p>
<p>So this story really has a happy ending. She&#8217;s happy where she is, and we&#8217;re all happy that she&#8217;s elsewhere. Hosebag. </span></p>
