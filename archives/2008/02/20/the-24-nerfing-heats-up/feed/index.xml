					<description><![CDATA[QUOTE 2007 from Leiahs blog

So this makes me wonder... if hawk + chugging mana pots 

every chance we can get, using a 1:1.5 marks shot rotation is our best way to do DPS, and never weave viper aspect into our method... what&#039;s the point of it (viper)? Strictly PvP? I can&#039;t use hawk in PvP really, cause mana issues are much, much more constrained and more important that typically trying to burst someone down.

Also, unless I&#039;m grouped with a shadowpriest, it&#039;s still very difficult not to go oom using a 1:1.5 marks shot rotation while chugging mana pots using hawk 100% of the time.

It just doesn&#039;t feel right at all. 



I am so glad you decided my mana pool was JUST NOT RIGHT
stupid asshole.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[And, interestingly enough, a comment from Rob Pardo at a talk at GDC (from my friend&#039;s blog):

&quot;Math is the foundation for all the game balancing you do. Rob talked about his design philosophy being that everything should feel overpowered - don&#039;t use the math to balance the game into mediocrity.&quot;

There&#039;s more than that in the article, but that&#039;s more or less what I was getting at.

					<description><![CDATA[Anyone who thinks that videogames aren&#039;t balanced by one guy (or just a few guys) is wrong. There are plenty of computations and statistics you can look at, but ultimately you have to using only numbers leads to a static, boring, cookie cutter game. So you end up with a few people (or one person) balancing the game based on how it feels.

If you are lucky, the person is good at his job. I suspect that Kalgan is just way more observable than most developers. And the stakes are much higher, because there are so many people playing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i think Tom Chilton, aka Kalgan, should be flagged for an auto rename to Commodus.  It seems to suit him much better.

I believe these recent nerfs are part of the blizzard politics to keep the shaman class below other classes, and force them to be substandard, which means they will often have to acquire a whole new set of gear to be resto, and although it seems to do well, i see resto shaman as the least dynamic healer in the game.  

I also believe that these changes are being made to support mages to fill the elemental shaman spots in arena.  If they weaken elemental shaman and with the buffs given to mages, such as 100% spell pushback resistance, 50% increased AOE damage, and increased casting speed that does not stack with bloodlust, they are effectively taking shaman out of the game.  good luck with that blizzard.]]></description>
