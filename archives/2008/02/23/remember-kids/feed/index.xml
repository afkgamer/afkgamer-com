					<description><![CDATA[@Anon,

Good tip on the recommended AH reading.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://ogsledger.blogspot.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Og&#039;s Ledger&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mmoauctioneer.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;mmo Auctioneer&lt;/a&gt;

So many WoW guides are faux guides with no real information, or they&#039;re just a front for advertising and gold sites.  Always enjoy new reading recommendations.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s very easy to make gold.  Just play the AH.

See mmo-auctioneer.com and Og&#039;s Ledger for walkthroughs on how to do this.

					<description><![CDATA[Hmm. What would people think to a &quot;casual&quot; epic flying mount that lasted X (60?) minutes, during which time you could mount/dismount as much as you wanted, but was on a 24h cooldown?

Make it available at a lower cost (heck, quest reward even - preferably not requiring a dungeon) and possibly make it ugly (certainly not using existing epic mount skins, that will cause the same QQ as using the same models for PVP and dungeon armour) - would people complain or be glad?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[the problem is that ppl who raid a lot end up farming to afford consumables and respecs with very little left over for a mount fund. it&#039;s kind of like wow is split into fighting classes and merchant/farmer classes. the former being poor folks on slow mounts in really nice gear, and the latter being rich folks on fast mounts and the nicest gear money can buy.

the ppl who have the best of both worlds spend a hell of a lot of time living inside the video game. =P]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Personally I think life&#039;s too short to constantly grind (which I hate doing anyway) for the mount, no matter how fast and shiny the dragons are /envy.  I always end up spending my money on something I need far more anyway :)]]></description>
