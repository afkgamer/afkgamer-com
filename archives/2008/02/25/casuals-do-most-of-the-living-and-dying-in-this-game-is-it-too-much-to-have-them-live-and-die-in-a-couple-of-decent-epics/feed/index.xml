	Comments on: Casuals do most of the living and dying in this game, is it too much to have them live and die in a couple of decent epics?	</title>

					<description><![CDATA[My favorite response to all of the hardcores is quite simple.

If you are the top 1% of the game, the best of the best, then you have pushed yourself UP OUT OF IMPORTANCE.

If the top 1% of players bitch and moan the loudest and quit, do you think Blizzard cares about a 1% drop in monthly revenue?  Thats all you are to them.  Do you think Blizzard cares about the 99% of their revenue from casuals?

Welcome to economics 101.  you priced yourselves out of the market!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post.  I don&#039;t miss hardcore gaming in Everquest.  I can manage to run a couple 25 man raids each week and actually have a social life outside of the game now.  I know that means I won&#039;t be first to have the finest gear and I accept that. 

All that being said, Blizzard is careful to release the casually obtained yet comparable gear quite a while after the hardcore folks have had a shot at it.  Still, if I were the one who spent all that time and effort early on to obtain the goods, I wouldn&#039;t be too happy... I guess I can just see both sides of it have raided hardcore in another game and now probably somewhere in the middle in WoW.]]></description>

And what was this?? 
     &quot;Rogues should never be nerfed because we have so little in this world (of warcraft).&quot;  
Please!!!  I got sapped and sapped and sappped*n by rogues in towers in AV, I am fully pissed and will kill any rogue 20 levels lower than me on sight!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think the contriversy about hardcore vs casual is getting sidelined with the pvp vs pve drama.  Because you don&#039;t have just two sides, you have 4 - it&#039;s a quadrant thing now, right?  You have casual pvpers and hardcore pvp, and casual raiders, and all the other instances of combos out there.  WoW originally had one focus - make the game playable for everyone.  Then as it grew, at the top end, you had to raid for good stuff (Ony/BWL/AQ/etc stuff was head and shoulders above anythign you could get non-raiding, and that&#039;s fine - you could play the game with what you got otherwise, it was just easier with your raid gear.

Today, however, I can pvp my way to epicness, at a level that skews the RVR scale against raiders.  Couple that with a lot of the class changes to the PVE game (and thus raiding) driven by PvP changes, and you get another level of anger from the hardcore raiders.

From my perspective, the game&#039;s promise to be everything to everyone has become unmanagable, and they need to make a decision to make it more of a PvP game (which is where it is going) and lessen the PvE focus or stop tuning around PvP and enhance the PvE game.  You cannot have both at the same time, successfully, for long.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While I agree that effort should equal reward, and there has to be a reason why significant chunks of your life is dedicated to progression: to being better - but I think some of the complaining by casuals is that when they play they are then competing against hardcores that are because of efforts equiped out better, be it Herorics, or BG&#039;s or on a PVP Sever, 
  
and If they introduced purpose equipable Items Eg a Weapon you can only weild in a high end instance  hardcores wouldnt want to progress there as much if they can&#039;t use the reward  - Another way to address this inequality and what Blizzard seem to be trying is the idea of a &#039;prerolled Character&#039; with the new Arena tornements - apparently you have equal gear,  and the test really is the person behind the toon, and not what you have equiped.]]></description>
