					<description><![CDATA[This popped up on the shaman forums as well, with the addition of: 

The Guy Who Runs the Guild- He&#039;s been here a long time. Like forever. He&#039;s an officer if he accepted the position. He knows all the gossip and understands the politics. For the love of God, don&#039;t make this guy decide that you are hurting the guild. The last GM did.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We had a backbone (dc&#039;ed on Chromag, held aggro, survived through the enrage, then reconnected during loot).  Now he&#039;s one of the most devout with me (he&#039;s the ele, I&#039;m the enhance).

I seem to bounce between the negative and positive officer.  Mostly it&#039;s whether our main RL is on, then I&#039;m the positive officer to piss him off.  (Zomg, longstanding senior officer/main RL feud! dramadramadrama)

I think I have a lifetime membership to the drunks though.  We even had that channel too.  For us it was /join peoplehates.  In honor of our main (and, sadly, worst) RL, who&#039;d made no attempts to hide the fact that he&#039;d replace the lot of us if he could (which he couldn&#039;t since a) half of us were officers and b) we were more well liked than he was).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Stala,

The negative officer, of course.  Without the authority.  Giving me access to the /gkick command would be a very bad idea.

Our drunks have a channel similar to the stoners above.  Only the most professional alcohol abusers in the guild get an invite to /join snark where everyone&#039;s performance is up for our review.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i could have written that summary.
My guild used to have pretty much all of them except for the drunks. After some trouble with a clique of 3 who played in a lan and got drunk together every raid we kinda clampled down on that (coincidentally we had more stoners ever after).
our backbone tanked Golemag through 3 disconnects and 47% percent once without loosing aggro. i&#039;ve never found another tank like him (sadly he changed to nightshift at some point after Naxx).]]></description>
