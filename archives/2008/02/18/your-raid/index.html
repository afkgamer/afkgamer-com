	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>From the World of Warcraft general (and class/realm/guild relations) forums, <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=4665317893&#038;sid=1">These are the People in your Raid</a> by level 10 posting alt, Peri of the Terokkar realm (I think.  It&#8217;s been passed around all the forums so many times now, who knows.):</p>
<blockquote><p>The Raid-</p>
<p>You raid with these people. You work with these people. These people are closer than your family. You should worry.</p>
<p>The GM- He&#8217;s sacrificed his health, friends, and probably a couple of jobs to drag you through new content. When the guild isn&#8217;t performing, these decisions are in question. Prone to shooting sprees, forum flame wars, and the rapid advancement/gearing of whatever toon the guild &#8220;needs&#8221;. If you can keep your mouth shut, he&#8217;ll go emo and quit before you get gkicked. Still, you do like the guy. Or did. Before he went crazy. See drunks, below.</p>
<p>The GM&#8217;s Significant Other- Okay, so he was going to have to quit but he tricked his SO into playing. She loves it. She&#8217;s terrible. You&#8217;ll effectively 24 man every boss. Count on 4 constructs in the raid, every attempt. She plays a Belf.</p>
<p>The Raid Leader- When you stand in the flames, he dies a little bit inside.</p>
<p>The Heir Apparent- When the GM goes psycho, ninjas the bank, and gdisbands, you&#8217;re the guy the guild is gonna look to to to fix the mess. You see it coming. You can&#8217;t decide if ritual suicide or being the new gm would be more painful.</p>
<p>The Positive Officer- That was great. Just great. You know, only 5% of guilds have even made it to Supremus, and getting him down to 67% on the second attempt is hawt. See Stoners, below.</p>
<p>The Negative Officer- Jesus Christ why are there corpses under all these goddamn volcanoes? It&#8217;s Supremus for %@*@&#8217;s sake. GET OUT OF THE GODDAMN FLAME! See Drunks, below.</p>
<p>The Healing Officer- Has this job because, as the newest officer who plays a healer, he&#8217;s stuck with it.</p>
<p>The Hunter Class Lead- Will tell you that it does actually require skill and preparation to play a hunter well in the end game. Lies frequently.</p>
<p>Metermaid- He&#8217;s got meters running. Always. Asks for meter postage whenever he&#8217;s in the top 5, which is rare, as his focus on the meters is preventing him from seeing the volcano he&#8217;s pathing towards. Pulls aggro. Has yet to realize that 0 health returns 0 dps. If he&#8217;s healing, you might as well just put him on raid, he&#8217;s gonna heal them anyway.</p>
<p>Stratman- Has read every strategy on the entire internet for every boss. Unable to think critically. Knows where his talk key is. Hated by the officers. Likely to play a hunter or mage. If this is also Chick With Accent, below, guild will probably collapse.</p>
<p>The Gay Guy- Affects the gay accent for effect. Upgrade decisions tend to involve lengthy discussions about gear appearance. Learned to use the dressing room function before the v key.</p>
<p>The Stay At Home Mom- She&#8217;s around children all day and craves adult conversation. Babbles incessantly in vent, forgetting that adult conversation doesn&#8217;t usually begin with, &#8220;So I was talking to (insert name of four-year-old child) and he says &#8230;&#8221; Well liked, but frequently muted.</p>
<p>Mr. Mikeless- Has a microphone. Hears the conversation and directions. Once wiped the raid because he started talking and most folks alt-tabbed to see who the hell was speaking. May be your best player.</p>
<p>The Kid- So, you messed up on this guy&#8217;s interview and nobody noticed that he was 12. But, he can play. And if he gets a little bit excited when boobies are getting talked about? Hey, he&#8217;s young.</p>
<p>The Backbone- Plays a tank. Doesn&#8217;t have much to say. Made an error once in SSC, or so you heard. Will disconnect when Gorefiend is at 30% and keep aggro while offline for the rest of the fight. Has never said anything negative to the healers. Ever. GL with your progression without one of these. Hates the prima donnas.</p>
<p>The Other kid- Remember that accountant you interviewed for the fury warrior position? And how you wondered how he&#8217;d make time to raid during tax season? He couldn&#8217;t. His eleven year old daughter took over about that time. She&#8217;s been raiding since. Mages, that&#8217;s an eleven year-old girl owning you night after night.</p>
<p>The Hunter Who Doesn&#8217;t Do His Homework- Always good for insightful commentary and clever observation just after a wipe. &#8220;Holy Crap Man! I was just standing and shooting and this damn VOLCANO popped on me! When did they put in those volcanoes?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Prophet- Kept insisting that you were going to need a melee group for BT, despite the fact hat melee was dreadful for SSC/BT. Badgered the management until they broke. Plays a rogue. Shreds. Loved by the Most Devout.</p>
<p>The Most Devout- This is the guy who gets to play an off-spec in a big-boy raid. He&#8217;s the fury warrior or the enhance shammy. He cannot believe that some fate is letting him have this much fun that he&#8217;s afraid it will all come crashing down. Prays devoutly to his favorite diety that the guild won&#8217;t collapse because he&#8217;ll never have THIS much fun again. Ever.</p>
<p>The Drunks- The core of your guild. As raid progresses, their voices in vent are getting just ever so slightly slurred. You don&#8217;t notice because you&#8217;re trying to sound sober yourself. DPS output seems to scale positively with blood alcohol content.</p>
<p>The Stoners- Quietly wiping raids since the beta. They really, really, really hate having to move out of the fire. Two of them are dead under the volcanoes. They live in fear of the negative officer. They have their own channel. Try /join (insertguildname)stoners. You&#8217;ll see who&#8217;s in there. It&#8217;ll explain a lot. Still, if these guys don&#8217;t show, bosses don&#8217;t seem to actually die. They&#8217;re also having more fun that everyone else combined.</p>
<p>The Prima Donna- Requires special attention from management. Constantly whining. Plays some vital role. Might be a main tank, mage tank, or lock tank. The officers really hate this guy and as soon as they can find another tank with 24,000 buffed HP, he&#8217;s out. Not a stoner.</p>
<p>The Chick with the Accent- Is the accent fake? Nobody knows or cares. Future visits to Australia/Britian/New Zealand/Alabama are now planned by all single raid members.</p>
<p>The Healing Pallie- Hates healing and had to go holy to see endgame. If you raid with a boomkin, a feral druid, a fury warrior, or any non-resto shaman, you are not getting a 10 minute blessing. Forget it. He hates you. God help you if he has a raid-viable alt in one of those classes; you&#8217;re not even getting heals. Also, see Prima Donna.</p>
<p>The Departed Legend- You joined after he left. You suspect that he could not actually solo Doomwalker. But you&#8217;re not totally sure.</p>
<p>The Disgruntled Raider- Took an unannounced, extended vacation and now has to share his raid spot with the other 11 extra dps. Very angry about this situation. Doesn&#8217;t realize that ##@#*ing is making things worse. Officers pray for a gquit.</p>
<p>The Warlock Whisperer- Directionally challenged. Despite having run Karazhan 1.26 million times, will require a summon to Maiden&#8217;s room from the entrance. Has a &#8220;summon pls&#8221; macro. Strangely, is good at moving away from volcanoes. See (you guessed it) Stoners.</p>
<p>The New Guy- Begins most sentences with, &#8220;That&#8217;s not how we did it in my old guild on Korgath.&#8221; Likely to remain guilded for approximately one week. You wonder if he&#8217;ll be tellign his next guild, &#8220;In my old guild, we ran TOWARDS the volcanoes.</p>
<p>Note: I read a similar archetype post couple years ago, when I first started raiding. It altered the way I viewed raiding forever after and I&#8217;ve tended to think of my guildies along these terms since.</p></blockquote>
<p>We had a &#8220;Chick with the Accent&#8221; in our guild recently.  I&#8217;ll use the word charming because this is a family blog.  But lemme tell ya, after a few battlegrounds and raids, it wasn&#8217;t so charming.  </p>
<p>She left recently to follow her game boyfriend (who I suspect is married to another woman IRL but I never said anything because it&#8217;s frankly none of my business), they went to another guild because he decided he hated our guild.</p>
<p>That was cool though &#8212; those two were the types who screenshot every single game conversation to prove whatever secret agenda they had that day.  Was really annoying to get their screenshots all the time in my email about how Soandso disrespected them or Whosit was mean to their friend.</p>
<p>Despite the (formerly) charming accent, habitual convo screenshotters mean one thing to me:  DRAMA WHORES.  They are to be avoided at all costs, and, for your own safety, do not send them any /tells.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>One of the hunters in my first endgame guild was a micless guy from China. Sure enough, he wiped a ZG run when he went out and bought one. His &#8220;command&#8221; of the English language made it worth it, though; totally priceless.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>i could have written that summary.<br />
My guild used to have pretty much all of them except for the drunks. After some trouble with a clique of 3 who played in a lan and got drunk together every raid we kinda clampled down on that (coincidentally we had more stoners ever after).<br />
our backbone tanked Golemag through 3 disconnects and 47% percent once without loosing aggro. i&#8217;ve never found another tank like him (sadly he changed to nightshift at some point after Naxx).</p>

<p>The negative officer, of course.  Without the authority.  Giving me access to the /gkick command would be a very bad idea.</p>
<p>Our drunks have a channel similar to the stoners above.  Only the most professional alcohol abusers in the guild get an invite to /join snark where everyone&#8217;s performance is up for our review.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>We had a backbone (dc&#8217;ed on Chromag, held aggro, survived through the enrage, then reconnected during loot).  Now he&#8217;s one of the most devout with me (he&#8217;s the ele, I&#8217;m the enhance).</p>
<p>I seem to bounce between the negative and positive officer.  Mostly it&#8217;s whether our main RL is on, then I&#8217;m the positive officer to piss him off.  (Zomg, longstanding senior officer/main RL feud! dramadramadrama)</p>
<p>I think I have a lifetime membership to the drunks though.  We even had that channel too.  For us it was /join peoplehates.  In honor of our main (and, sadly, worst) RL, who&#8217;d made no attempts to hide the fact that he&#8217;d replace the lot of us if he could (which he couldn&#8217;t since a) half of us were officers and b) we were more well liked than he was).</p>
