					<description><![CDATA[Well, it&#039;s nice to know that my battlegroup (Vindication) really is the worst one out there :P

We have some success when people move with the zerg, but otherwise, gah.

What really confuses me though is when I roll in with my S3/T6 enhance sham we get steamrolled.  But, I queue up for kicks with my blue and green 70 warrior alt and we win instantly.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That Ruin ratio is actually a little higher than reality.  I leveled up a BE lock solely to PVP with and since I got her to 70 my AV record is an abysmal 11-57.  For the rest of the BGs, I&#039;m at a combined 93-10 or so.  For whatever reason, whenever I jump into an AV with the Horde on Ruin they all go retarded.  I don&#039;t get it.  Maybe I just have that effect on people.

And I transferred from a low/med pop server to a high pop server a few months ago and don&#039;t regret it at all.  Sure it&#039;s harder to farm mobs/resources or do dailies - hello Netherwing mine - but there&#039;s always something to do and I wouldn&#039;t trade that for anything.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Huh. Reckoning isn&#039;t as bad as I thought. Although we are pretty terrible. I refuse to enter a WSG that isn&#039;t a premade anymore. (real premade to win - not that pansy let&#039;s dance in the GY crap).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is interesting too.  Also via WarcraftRealms.

&lt;strong&gt;Horde to Alliance Win Ratio - All Level 70 Battlegrounds&lt;/strong&gt;
Alterac Valley .984
Arathi Basin 1.484 (see what I mean about that blacksmith bridge??)
Warsong Gulch 1.255
Eye of the Storm 1.516

Our paladins DO suck.  I knew it all along.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;It may be bad on your battlegroup now, but the numbers overall are showing a 50/50 split between the Horde and Alliance for AV since the reinforcement changes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

True.  And I&#039;m all for 50/50, but zero bonus for the losers is bullshit, whether it&#039;s Horde or Alliance losing.  They fix that and everyone&#039;s happy -- happiER anyways.  I&#039;d still grumble about the map, the way I grumble about the AB map and how our bridge to blacksmith should be inched closer to our stables flag, but I&#039;m not getting ZERO for a losing AB.

And hey!  there&#039;s worse battlegroups than mine:

&lt;strong&gt;Horde to Alliance Level-70 AV Win Ratio&lt;/strong&gt;
Bloodlust .655
Cataclysm 3.700
Cyclone .593
Emberstorm 1.274
Frenzy (insufficent data)
Nightfall 1.171
Rampage 1.624
Reckoning .894
Retaliation 3.047
Ruin .749
Shadowburn .833
Stormstrike 1.776
Vengeance 1.129
Vindication .521 (omg, choke them at IBGY)
Whirlwind 1.111
Overall for US battlegroups .984
