					<description><![CDATA[His &quot;honor over time&quot; being more important than winning was the very reason horde use to lose by a 3 to 1 ratio all the time. People would not even try but instead deliberately lose, because if you captured a few towers, and held a few, you&#039;d only get 600 less honor than the winner. So losing fast became the strategy.

I expect once the new 2.4 changes to come in, horde in all battlegroups will go back to that same strategy.]]></description>
