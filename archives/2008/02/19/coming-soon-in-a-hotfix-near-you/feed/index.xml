					<description><![CDATA[Nothing good since &#039;06 in outdoor chests. Occasional green or gem in pickpocketed boxes. I&#039;d give away my dungeon stealth runs, but I don&#039;t want them to get the fix.

The first rule about chest farming is you don&#039;t talk about chest farming. ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Are you serious? I treasurehunt outlands outdoor chests all the time on my dorf, great source of hp/mana pots and the whatever herbs/ores/bars you get too.

Not gotten any greens in the outlands-outlands ones, but the pre-outlands-outlands ones (the ones that give cherry pies and morning glory dew) once yeilded a blue sword for my priest in terrokar.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[World chests have mostly been typical white junk, but twice I&#039;ve had BoE blue items, that sold for a packet. I open every chest I see, and always empty them.

The chest in the Skettis area is a good one too, as it has a good amount of stuff and is unguarded.]]></description>
