					<description><![CDATA[We just had the worst free for all battle on the island started by four priests on the shadowmoon server. It was 2 horde priests and 2 alliance priests. Whenever, one would almost die the opposing faction priests would mind control and heal them.  Eventually so many people were trying to kill them that things got out of control and a faction war broke out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I&#039;m on Lightbringer and the first few days were pretty well camped (especially the Hellfire quests before they fixed the spawn rates) but it&#039;s been a lot easier the last few days, especially if you form a group with some guildies and plow through the dailies together. I would not reccomend doing the bombing quest alone, ever, unless you want to make that flight 5-6 times, heh.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Richard - you can alter the variables file you upload.  The addon didn&#039;t record my server&#039;s progress on phase 2 for me so I went in there and manually added it and recalculated the md5.  It wasn&#039;t hard but I also didn&#039;t artificially bloat it either.

I&#039;m on one of the top 5 servers and the first day was definitely nuts, especially the two Hellfire dailies at the Throne of Kil&#039;jaeden.  It is fairly well settled down by now.  The bombing run is a pain in the ass to solo due to the sheer number of people doing it but getting a group is simple.  However, the Arm the Wards daily can kiss my ass.  Having to kill mana drain mobs as a holy paladin is complete crap.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amen to the mailbox and repair vendor.  Everyone on my server can&#039;t shut their damn mouths about how their going to get all the sweet badge loot as soon as phase 3 opens up (of which there really is very little), and I&#039;m stuck alone in the corner cheering for the fact that I won&#039;t have to hearth or take an excruciatingly long flight to get back to anywhere I can re-supply, repair, and read mail.  Screw badge loot, I just want a post office!]]></description>
