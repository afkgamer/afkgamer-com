					<description><![CDATA[Goon Squad isn&#039;t technically an &quot;EJ Feeder Guild&quot; though EJ is made up of ex GS members. I think they were like the core raiders at the time and left to make their own guild pretty much at the same time the game went live.

Commenter up above was right, GS is made up of Something Awful forum members, anyone with $10 can join.

And EJ&#039;s not even the most elite guild on Mal&#039;Ganis anymore. Two years ago, maybe. =P]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Want an item that drops, but don&#039;t have the DKP? No problem, DKP can be purchased for $1 per point. (DKP gift certificates are also available.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Purchased DKP can be used instantly as soon as your funds clear, and generally before bidding begins on an item raiders are given the opportunity to purchase more DKP.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Is it just me, or does anyone else see them having a serious problem with Blizzard over this?  Seriously, is there any difference, ethically, between this and gold selling?  (Note that gold sellers do a lot of other things that aren&#039;t kosher and are highly annoying/disruptive, which is another subject.)]]></description>
