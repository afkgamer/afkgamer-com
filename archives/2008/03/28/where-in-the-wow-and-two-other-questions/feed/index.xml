					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I can accept if they want to break boss announcement mods for some reason&lt;/strong&gt; which only their leetness can understand, and I can accept that raiders have to watch the boss targeting to see who&#039;s going to be the lucky one to take an orb to the face, &lt;strong&gt;but they (the royal Developers They) can&#039;t have it both ways.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Um, did you read that wrong? Let&#039;s look again:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a bug in that there is currently no combat log message for him casting Arcane Orb (just the impact message), &lt;strong&gt;causing boss mods to not work. &lt;em&gt;This will be fixed&lt;/em&gt; in a future patch.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They didn&#039;t mean to break the bossmods, and they&#039;re gonna fix that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Warcraftrealms is where I&#039;ve been checking a lot of our recent applicants.  We had one that basically hopped guilds every week for a year, then applied to us.

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know the first question.

The second one is most likely because a developer oversight (or some internal tweak gone wrong) and left a bug.  And there is no way to push a patch that quickly in such a big company, so it is postponed.

The third one, I feel for you man.  It will be really great if you can get some of the pics, like last one :-)]]></description>
