					<description><![CDATA[Foton, I love your guild drama posts.  They always serve as a great reminder as to why I am not in a raid guild.

On the warlock issue, I play a shadow priest (now speced dis much it my own annoyance) so I generally do not like to see warlock nerfs because most of the time they nerf my shadow priest as well. In my opinion the pet classes in this game have always been on the overpowered side.  In the past warlocks did not bother me so much because at least they took some skill to play.  This is no longer the case.  These days all they have to do is DOT, skillqoil/fear, and drain life over and over again.  Hell in WSG I prefer a warlock flag carrier to anything else but a druid with the damage and survivability that warlocks have today.

That dev post about class percentages in the arenas is pretty funny.  What a short sighted metric.  This game is run by monkeys I swear.  Maybe if I send Blizzard a crate of bananas I can get VE changed to an aura.  That would rock =)

And yes they are nerfing priests Focused Will.  Fully geared dis priests are pretty hard to kill.  But then so are restro druids so I don&#039;t now why they are fing with priests again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, Kalgan confirmed that the life tap nerf is being repealed because apparently warlocks aren&#039;t as popular in the arenas as they thought. He actually has percentages of classes in the top arena teams which I guess Blizzard uses to determine who gets nerfed/buffed.

For me the frustrating thing about warlocks is their ability to entirely shut down my holy paladin by just sending using a felhunter. Life Tap combined with Drain Life does allow them to not worry about mana in arenas and probably needs some modification but switching from a fixed amount to a percentage was a little much.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am so very tired of the classes I play getting changed because of, not PvP in general, but ARENAS specifically.It not only FUBAR&#039;s PvE but BG as well.

Druids are going to get it, and hell looking at those numbers and according to Blue in that thread, priests can expect a nerf stick anytime now.

Oh and let&#039;s see, Hunters should be getting buffed along with the Paladins, and Shamans apparently]]></description>
