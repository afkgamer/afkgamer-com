					<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t say I&#039;m surprised that she&#039;s on there, with all the publicity she has been doing lately... Or maybe, it&#039;s a sign. Maybe in the near future we will be sitting in the cinema, eargely waiting to see the horror that is Lady Sylvannas in the WoW epic movie. Then BAM, 300 people sitting there looking at an ageold singer/model/actor(WTF?) with makeups trying to make her look undead, but only making her look slightly better.
Dear God, I beg of you, strike her down.]]></description>
