					<description><![CDATA[Ah well. Let&#039;s face it. when it was announced, we all thought it was due in July 06. We&#039;ve waited this long, we can wait a little longer. Maybe it&#039;s time to give myself a hoarde alt, for a break.

That said, it&#039;ll give me lots of time for Gears Of War.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Part of me is kinda upset that the expansion isn&#039;t going to be released &quot;as it should have been&quot;.   I stopped playing 5 months ago, for lack of &quot;casual&quot; content, and my inability to join a raiding guild with no retarded schedules, and i what i&#039;ve seen and read about the xpac so far really made me want to play again.

On the other hand, i know Blizzard (sounds like a fanboi rant, eh ?) and i know that these two extra months means more polish, more details, eck, even a few more quests and fluff for us to enjoy until the next xpac.

Now if only i could find something to play until January .. :)]]></description>
