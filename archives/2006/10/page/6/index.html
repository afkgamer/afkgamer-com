				<div class="entry-content">
			<p><small>(<strong>PREFACE:</strong>  I&#8217;ve coaxed Raster, guild bud and raid leader oft-extraordinaire, out from behind the scenes of AFK Gamer to recount some of his stories from the olde days.  Many times in EverQuest, and now in World of Warcraft, while pushing out levels or waiting around for named spawns to show, we&#8217;ve asked Raster to tell us one of his Old Man Stories &#8212; that is, a gaming story or server drama from the early EQ (DAoC, AC, UO, <em>et al</em>) days.  </p>
<p>His ability to recall fight details, player names and loot drops is absolutely unmatched.  So is his ability to hold a grudge, but you&#8217;ll discover that soon enough.</p>
<p>So, whenever the time starts to drag or the trash clearing begins to run long, we&#8217;ll ask Raster:  Tell us a story about the old days.  </p>
<p>And he&#8217;ll say something like:  Do you wanna hear about the first time we killed The Froglok King in EQ? &#8211; Foton)</small></p>
<p>The good old days. Cliche?  Probably.  However, still quite accurate.  For all I felt went wrong in the later days of EverQuest, I truly enjoyed the beginning. The vast majority of content was solo or group based and there was a more direct relationship between effort and reward. Most zones were setup to hold multiple groups with multiple named areas available to drop various equipment.  Groups would go on for hours, leveling took time and while gear was nice, skill was still important.  I may be in the minority, but I always preferred to work a little rather than the instant gratification approach World of Warcraft (WoW) has taken.</p>
<p>I still remember our server&#8217;s first attempt at The Froglok King, boss of the live side of Lower Guk.  There were no online guides, no maps of the dungeon, just a few groups exploring reaches we&#8217;d never seen and with no idea of what was to come.</p>
<p>If you never played EverQuest, you may be wondering why this would be exciting to anyone.  Lower Guk was a rather large zone split into a live and dead side (similiar to WoW&#8217;s Stratholme).  However, unlike WoW instances, Lower Guk was not nearly as streamlined to lead you towards any boss.  There were numerous tunnels intertwined and leading nowhere in particular, loaded with roaming mobs on top of the regular spawns, none of which would reset until you were dead &#8230; no matter where you ran.  There were invisible walls, holes in floors, you name it, you probably wandered into it&#8230;and paid the price.</p>
<p>Still wondering?  When you died in Everquest, all of your gear and gold stayed on your corpse exactly where you died.  You went back to wherever you were bound (much like a hearthstone however not restricted to certain locations) no matter how far away that may have been.  Sometimes you could spend more time getting your body back when you were logged on than actually killing things.</p>
<p>This may not have been the most player-friendly method, but it sure as hell added a risk/reward factor that does not really exist in WoW.  Try to imagine three groups of players (15 total) blindly roaming through a zone none of us had ever been in and knew nothing about, looking for a boss we didn&#8217;t know existed.</p>
<p>We slaughtered the entrance Frogloks and plowed through the Minotaurs behind them.  Through much trial and error we made our way through the winding tunnels and emerged in a water filled room with three planks to allow passage.  Halfway through the room I noticed something out of the corner of my screen making a beeline for us. Holy shit, it&#8217;s a huge eye and it&#8217;s nuking us!  People frantically scurried about, some taking a swim, as we tried to group up and engage it.  Once it was downed, we were rewarded with the server&#8217;s first Manastone (no-cooldown right-click health-for-mana item, unlimited use.  Oh yes, imagine the power).</p>
<p>Continuing on, we passed the Froglok Fort (we later learned the Froglok Crusader spawned inside) followed the path down some terrain (Froglok Noble spawn) and came to a room with a seemingly well-guarded dead end.  Oh shit, it was actually an invisible wall and the Frogloks came pouring through to greet us, along with the Huge Water Elemental (which was ironically quite tiny).  Splat.</p>
<p>A few hours, and many dead Frogloks later, we returned to the spot of our quick, bloody demise to try again (respawn was 20ish minutes &#8212; you mess up, you redo it all).  Our friendly water elemental was turned into a puddle in short order and in the next room we met a few Frogloks and their gargoyle buddies, who were also dispatched of.  Finally, after all of this time, we came upon the King&#8217;s chamber complete with throne and what do we see other than a Froglok Guk Knight.  Fuck! (In Everquest, bosses did not always spawn and often had placeholders you had to continually clear until the boss finally spawned.)</p>
<p>It took 7 spawns for The Froglok King to appear and two of his guards respawned during the battle, healing him back to full quite a few times.  Our Clerics and Paladins tried to stun, tanks tried to keep the adds under control and our casters unloaded their wads.  One guard died, then the second and the King was alone again.  When he was finally getting low on health what else happens but he uses Lay of Hands on himself (similiar to paladin ability in WoW, massive paladin-only heal).  Undaunted, we pressed on and six of us fell before he finally keeled over at our feet.  For all of our time and effort we were rewarded with the first Mithril Two-Handed Sword (best 2h sword to date at the time on our realm) as well as it being the first server kill.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to hoping developers start innovating and making things new and fun again instead of following the same old, and quickly tiring, formula.</p>

			<p>By now, every World of Warcraft player and his (or her) imaginary girlfriend (or sex toy) has heard about the impending removal of auto-targeting type mods from the game, ala Decursive.  (Link to a <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=32277853">good central thread</a> with other links for you to chase.)  Blizzard dripping tree, Drysc, summarizes the official position:  &#8220;The general run-down is that we don&#8217;t want UI mods to be making combat decisions for a player, it should be in their hands and their responsibility to choose who and when to interact with the game. It borders on automation of gameplay, which is something we&#8217;re obviously very opposed to. Aside from that moral separation it ends up defeating the purpose of the challenges we&#8217;re implementing. With the release of the expansion and the game changing in some huge ways, it was the best opportunity to remove specific UI mod abilities.&#8221;  Which, to me, could mean either:  A. We decided AE curse encounters were stupid and are taking the game in a different direction, chillax noobs, or B. We still don&#8217;t learn from our predecessors&#8217; mistakes.  Since players are given only half the story &#8230; again &#8230;, I s&#8217;pose we&#8217;ll decide either:  A.  That wasn&#8217;t so bad, or B.  God, that was stupid.  (ALSO, could we get a firm fucking date on this expansion?  Six-ish weeks away and we&#8217;re still guessing on live date?)

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Let&#8217;s start off the week with a short list &#8212; five advanced tips for making a World of Warcraft alt.  These won&#8217;t be your basic blah-blah tips like:  collect a ton of quests, run out and complete, hearth back, rinse, repeat, use your main to assist with the tougher quests &#8230; I mean, DUH!  We all know that.  These tips are for guys like us:  we&#8217;ve already played the game far too much, we&#8217;ve made far too many alts already, we&#8217;re h4rdc0&#8242;, we know the sco&#8217;, give us some mo&#8217;, ya, fo&#8217; sho&#8217;.  Now look at that, I was rapping.  And I discover yet another skill I didn&#8217;t realize I had.</p>
<p>(Ok.  I promise not to do that again.)</p>
<p>Anyways, here&#8217;s the short list of how I approach alt-making in World of Warcraft today, pre-expansion_01, because you must know that the expansion will change almost everything, including alt making:</p>
<p>1.  <strong>Choosing your alt&#8217;s professions</strong>.  Choose professions to help out your main because your main is going to be your alt&#8217;s sugar daddy &#8212; shouldn&#8217;t the main get a little something, y&#8217;know, for the effort?  Of course he/she should!  One caveat:  don&#8217;t choose both herbalism AND mining, nublet.   The default map only marks one of the spawnable resources which will drive you nuts before you leave noob-town.  </p>
<p>Personally, I like enchanting or skinning AND herbalism or mining, although my latest alt is enchanting and skinning because I&#8217;ve become SO lazy, I don&#8217;t want to check my minimap anymore.</p>
<p>Secondary professions (cooking, first aid, fishing):  First aid and nothing else.  You either have a 300 fisherman and a 300 chef in your stable already or know someone who does.  Plus, honestly, fishing and cooking won&#8217;t make or break the game either way.  First aid, however, will.</p>
<p>2.  <strong>A little gold goes a long way.</strong>  Before you even enter the noob playpen with your new alt, mail him/her a few gold and a full set of backpacks.  You already played the game straight by struggling to buy spells/skills every other level and trying to beat down Edwin VanCleef with a rusty dagger.  This alt is for speed AND comfort, give him some walking-around money for the ride.  </p>
<p>If he loots some nice gear along the way, super, but since we both know he won&#8217;t, just buy the shit off the Auction House and be done with it.</p>
<p>3.  <strong>Asking for help</strong>.  If your main (and/or bigger level alt) will be flying down to noob-town to help out the alt with the tougher quests and elite mobs, cool &#8230; ditto if a guildmate will help you out.  Certainly, for instances, you will want the big guys&#8217; help.  </p>
<p>For the single elite mob quest, I don&#8217;t even bother with that anymore &#8212; my main has become as lazy as my alts.  IF the quest is worth doing (this is increasingly questionable when we&#8217;re talking about alts), I&#8217;ll ask one of the Show Off Dudes in the zone to give me a hand.  </p>
<p>Allow me to explain.  There are two reasons why a level 60 hangs out near noob-town:  1.  they are incredibly bored (uncommon) or 2.  they are showing off for the noobs (common).  I figure, what better way for the Show Off Dudes to do exactly that than offing some elite mob for me?  Instances, I&#8217;ll get help from my main or from the guild &#8212; outdoor elite mobs, Show Off Dudes are the way to go.</p>
<p>Ask nicely &#8212; even I would help ya out.</p>
<p>4.  <strong>Be paid for your services.</strong>  I know new-to-the-game nublets like to make guilds of new-to-the-game nublets.  I know that, I don&#8217;t understand it, but I do know that.  If some dude needs me to sign his guild charter so he can have his little circle of gaming buds in a guild, I&#8217;m cool with that.  I expect him to ask me first and not thrust the charter onto my screen without a word.  Same goes for the ninja guild invite.  And if they have a conversation with me first, I do explain &#8220;no thank you, not looking for a guild&#8221; (got my hands full with the other guild donchaknow).</p>
<p>But, I also know that most of these wordless charter situations are well-funded alts looking to make a vanity guild.  I&#8217;m cool with that too, however, I expect to be paid for that service.  My minimum price for a charter signature is 1 gold.  They need the noobs for their little project, they should pay the noobs &#8212; that&#8217;s how I look at it.  As far as they know, I&#8217;m a noob, so open those pursestrings and fork over a gold.</p>
<p>Like I said, if we have a conversation and I can tell that the guy doesn&#8217;t know up from Westfall, I&#8217;ll sign his charter no prob.  That charter from the level 60 druid for the guild &#8220;Brokeback Mountain Cowboys&#8221; costs 1 gold.  Actually, that one would cost 2 gold because that&#8217;s just damn stupid, albeit fitting for a fruity night elf druid.</p>
<p>5.  <strong>Don&#8217;t tell your guild.</strong>  And I cannot emphasize this point enough:  Until you are ready to premiere your alt, until he&#8217;s ready to graduate to &#8220;The Show&#8221;, DO NOT TELL YOUR GUILD.  Remember &#8220;speed AND comfort&#8221;?  Your alt is where you escape.  No drama, no whining, no complaints about the loot or the raid schedule, no requests to help Soandso&#8217;s brother with the jailbreak from Blackrock Depths (an odious quest, by the way), no requests for loans, and no inane conversations that start off with &#8220;hi.  how was your day?&#8221; because I always know where that convo is going &#8230; straight into how their day was.</p>
<p>And allow me to save you the pain of thinking you can tell a few people in the guild who your super-secret alt is and they won&#8217;t bust you at the worst moment possible &#8230; they will.  I know.  This is how it&#8217;ll go:  Guild says, we need another whatever-class for this BRD jailbreak for Soandso&#8217;s brother, does anyone know when Foton will be online?  Guild-idiot-I-thought-I-could-trust says, he&#8217;s online right now.  Guild says, where, we don&#8217;t see him.  Guild-idiot says, he&#8217;s on his warlock NotFoton&#8217;sWarlock.  </p>
<p>Next thing I knew, I&#8217;m getting tells from guildmates asking if that was my new warlock.  Fuck no, this is my new mage, your /who command is whacked.</p>
<p>And it was all downhill from there.</p>
