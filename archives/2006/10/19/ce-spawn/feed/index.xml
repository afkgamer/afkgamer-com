					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re right Byron, I wasn&#039;t able to preorder the collectors edition, but I did put my name down for it. In the end I&#039;m not sure I&#039;ll go for the collectors edition anyway since it seems a tad (?!) expensive. A$145 is a huge price for an expansion pack, even a collectors version.

In anycase, now that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://stroppsworld.com/2006/10/25/burning-crusade-delayed/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;expansion has been delayed&lt;/a&gt;, it will give me a chance to consider my options. And who knows, the delay may enable them to get some more copies to our sunny shores which could lower the final retail price.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Stropp, I preordered via EBgames.com, since my local Australian EBG got 60 copies to dole out across 800-odd existing non-CE preorders.  They&#039;re going through them in order and asking if the person who preordered wants to upgrade.  I was #400 or so in the list, and it just doesn&#039;t seem likely to get down to me.  I see from your own blog that you weren&#039;t able to preorder the CE there, either, so it&#039;s likely a national store policy to go down the list like that.

Total cost for my preorder will work out to be around AU$145, with shipping, bank fees for the US dollar transaction, and such, unless one economy or the other takes a sharp turn in the next few months.  So for ~$25 more than buying it locally, I have a pretty good shot at actually getting it (unless EBgames.com decide to screw me) and I get to wait an extra 3-5 business days (shya, 8-10 business days more likely) before I get to go through the DP and experience the lagalicious joy of it all.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I &lt;a href=&quot;http://stroppsworld.com/2006/10/20/biting-the-bc-bullet/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;posted &lt;/a&gt;on this, this morning. I went in to my local EBG last night and preordered. However, they had the collectors edition listed at 120 Aussie dollars. 

I didn&#039;t preorder to have it delivered as you did. I suspect that would have added a few quid to the price. Still I do hope that price was a mistake.]]></description>
