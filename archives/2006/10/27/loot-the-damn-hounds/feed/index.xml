					<description><![CDATA[Crappy guilds? LOL

Surely every raid is full of crap? it&#039;s full of 40 self-minded, often egotistical nerdy freaks with various personal issues. At least three of those 40 people are capable of ninjalooting, /gquit-ing and server transferring (possibly getting ebay ready) on a whim.

Why do you think we all visit afkgamer.com? For a lighthearted &#039;oh that&#039;ll never happen to me and my online buddies lols&#039; chuckle? Well partly yes - but you can&#039;t beat a bit of DRAMA :) That&#039;s what makes playing online interesting for me!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You guys are all in crappy guilds if you&#039;re worried about ninjalooting. I&#039;ve never been in a guild that used anything but FFA and I&#039;ve never seen any ninjalooting. If you don&#039;t trust the other 39 people on a raid with you, I feel really sorry for you and how lousy your WoW experience must be.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The shame loot thing is funny. Regarding ninja looters, after the bajillionth AQ40 run I have a hard enough time getting people to ask for items let alone have someone take without asking.

The only real problem are those that shift looted those goggles in MC i think.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[People shift click or have other accidents using FFA. Though usually someone one can ninja something once. 

People not looting is a constant problem starting with UBRS and continuing to all the dragon killing you have to do for the Ony key chain. No one wants to loot dragons.

Our group yells &quot;SHAME LOOT!&quot; where we all run up to the dog and click on it, so the person who didn&#039;t loot doesn&#039;t have to go up by himself. This started as a joke but now we do it all the time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I totally don&#039;t get this one. Who raids anywhere with their guild and doesn&#039;t use free-for-all loot? My guilds have always yelled at people that *do* loot the hounds as that&#039;s the responsibility of a single person who is collecting the cores and other drops for the guild bank.

What is the point of not using FFA? If you don&#039;t trust your guildmates, you need a new guild. Not a macro yelling at them to loot.]]></description>
