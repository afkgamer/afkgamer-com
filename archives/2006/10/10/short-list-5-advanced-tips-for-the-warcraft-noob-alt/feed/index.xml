					<description><![CDATA[A glorious post indeed.  I thought I was the only one who created secret alts just to get away sometimes.  Not because I don&#039;t like my friends.  But sometimes you just want to quest solo.

I wish I had learned the &quot;don&#039;t tell anyone about your secret identity&quot; earlier than I did.  But you learn quick when the friend you &lt;em&gt;did &lt;/em&gt;tell forgets you&#039;re on your alt and ninja groups you both with the friend you &lt;em&gt;didn&#039;t &lt;/em&gt;tell.  Oops.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Loved it, loved it.  I almost fell into the herbalism and mining trap, but before I trained either, the map thing occurred to me. So I went herbs and enchanting.  It&#039;s an important point that the alt should feed the main, or at least a more advanced alt.  The herbs to go the Alchemist alt that feds back pots to main and newer alt.  Enchanting - or more correctly, DISenchanting, is pure profit.  I haven&#039;t made back the return on investment from the first Enchanter on main.  I don&#039;t have the time or the patience to spam enchants.  DE&#039;g is the way to go.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Payment for signing a guild charter can be a really nice money boost for a new character who doesn&#039;t have a main on that server....  I&#039;ll often help out people get a guild started (if I&#039;m on an unguilded alt), if they&#039;re polite, especially if they&#039;re offering any payment.  The charters thrown up in my face, though, get declined and the guy ignored if he tries it again.

The other day, I was grinding when a guildie mentioned someone was trying to get signitures for a guild called &#039;Fellowship of the Bling&#039; - I thought that was such a good gag, it was worth switching over to an alt just to give them a signiture...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh yeah, I cannot overemphasise how important that last one is.

Only my RL friends know my alts true name ... oh and our GM as she ran past me in Duskwood one time whilst I was wearing my Furbolg outfit, she immediately guessed it was me, but was cool with me hiding with my unguilded alt.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was thinking about alts the other day - particularly the cunning ones. Surely someone will invent an addon that can allow you to track when a member of your guild goes offline and examines the Ironforge logons within the next two minutes? Said addon could collate said information over a period of time, and perhaps eventually allow you to spot your moonlighting guildies...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The seed money and full backpacks is a must. Also, since I play the AH a tad, I keep an eye out for good deals on items for my alts and buy them ahead of when I need them, so I&#039;m not stuck paying top dollar at the last minute. I just stash &#039;em in the bank until I&#039;m ready.

I do actually have one character with mining and herbalism. There&#039;s some odd bug I&#039;m experiencing that allows me to see both dots on my minimap at once if I have herbalism up. (I originally decided to do it before knowing of the bug, because at this point I have most resource nodes marked in Gatherer, so I know where to look for things and when to switch my detection sense over.) Hell no I won&#039;t be reporting that bug! :-P

It&#039;s definitely nice to have an alt that isn&#039;t guilded, purely for relaxation. like s4dfish though I have that on another server, since I&#039;ve run out of room on mine (or rather, I&#039;m saving two slots for Draenei).]]></description>
