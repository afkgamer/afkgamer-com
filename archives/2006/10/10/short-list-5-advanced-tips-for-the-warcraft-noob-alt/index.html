	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Let&#8217;s start off the week with a short list &#8212; five advanced tips for making a World of Warcraft alt.  These won&#8217;t be your basic blah-blah tips like:  collect a ton of quests, run out and complete, hearth back, rinse, repeat, use your main to assist with the tougher quests &#8230; I mean, DUH!  We all know that.  These tips are for guys like us:  we&#8217;ve already played the game far too much, we&#8217;ve made far too many alts already, we&#8217;re h4rdc0&#8242;, we know the sco&#8217;, give us some mo&#8217;, ya, fo&#8217; sho&#8217;.  Now look at that, I was rapping.  And I discover yet another skill I didn&#8217;t realize I had.</p>
<p>(Ok.  I promise not to do that again.)</p>
<p>Anyways, here&#8217;s the short list of how I approach alt-making in World of Warcraft today, pre-expansion_01, because you must know that the expansion will change almost everything, including alt making:</p>
<p>1.  <strong>Choosing your alt&#8217;s professions</strong>.  Choose professions to help out your main because your main is going to be your alt&#8217;s sugar daddy &#8212; shouldn&#8217;t the main get a little something, y&#8217;know, for the effort?  Of course he/she should!  One caveat:  don&#8217;t choose both herbalism AND mining, nublet.   The default map only marks one of the spawnable resources which will drive you nuts before you leave noob-town.  </p>
<p>Personally, I like enchanting or skinning AND herbalism or mining, although my latest alt is enchanting and skinning because I&#8217;ve become SO lazy, I don&#8217;t want to check my minimap anymore.</p>
<p>Secondary professions (cooking, first aid, fishing):  First aid and nothing else.  You either have a 300 fisherman and a 300 chef in your stable already or know someone who does.  Plus, honestly, fishing and cooking won&#8217;t make or break the game either way.  First aid, however, will.</p>
<p>2.  <strong>A little gold goes a long way.</strong>  Before you even enter the noob playpen with your new alt, mail him/her a few gold and a full set of backpacks.  You already played the game straight by struggling to buy spells/skills every other level and trying to beat down Edwin VanCleef with a rusty dagger.  This alt is for speed AND comfort, give him some walking-around money for the ride.  </p>
<p>If he loots some nice gear along the way, super, but since we both know he won&#8217;t, just buy the shit off the Auction House and be done with it.</p>
<p>3.  <strong>Asking for help</strong>.  If your main (and/or bigger level alt) will be flying down to noob-town to help out the alt with the tougher quests and elite mobs, cool &#8230; ditto if a guildmate will help you out.  Certainly, for instances, you will want the big guys&#8217; help.  </p>
<p>For the single elite mob quest, I don&#8217;t even bother with that anymore &#8212; my main has become as lazy as my alts.  IF the quest is worth doing (this is increasingly questionable when we&#8217;re talking about alts), I&#8217;ll ask one of the Show Off Dudes in the zone to give me a hand.  </p>
<p>Allow me to explain.  There are two reasons why a level 60 hangs out near noob-town:  1.  they are incredibly bored (uncommon) or 2.  they are showing off for the noobs (common).  I figure, what better way for the Show Off Dudes to do exactly that than offing some elite mob for me?  Instances, I&#8217;ll get help from my main or from the guild &#8212; outdoor elite mobs, Show Off Dudes are the way to go.</p>
<p>Ask nicely &#8212; even I would help ya out.</p>
<p>4.  <strong>Be paid for your services.</strong>  I know new-to-the-game nublets like to make guilds of new-to-the-game nublets.  I know that, I don&#8217;t understand it, but I do know that.  If some dude needs me to sign his guild charter so he can have his little circle of gaming buds in a guild, I&#8217;m cool with that.  I expect him to ask me first and not thrust the charter onto my screen without a word.  Same goes for the ninja guild invite.  And if they have a conversation with me first, I do explain &#8220;no thank you, not looking for a guild&#8221; (got my hands full with the other guild donchaknow).</p>
<p>But, I also know that most of these wordless charter situations are well-funded alts looking to make a vanity guild.  I&#8217;m cool with that too, however, I expect to be paid for that service.  My minimum price for a charter signature is 1 gold.  They need the noobs for their little project, they should pay the noobs &#8212; that&#8217;s how I look at it.  As far as they know, I&#8217;m a noob, so open those pursestrings and fork over a gold.</p>
<p>Like I said, if we have a conversation and I can tell that the guy doesn&#8217;t know up from Westfall, I&#8217;ll sign his charter no prob.  That charter from the level 60 druid for the guild &#8220;Brokeback Mountain Cowboys&#8221; costs 1 gold.  Actually, that one would cost 2 gold because that&#8217;s just damn stupid, albeit fitting for a fruity night elf druid.</p>
<p>5.  <strong>Don&#8217;t tell your guild.</strong>  And I cannot emphasize this point enough:  Until you are ready to premiere your alt, until he&#8217;s ready to graduate to &#8220;The Show&#8221;, DO NOT TELL YOUR GUILD.  Remember &#8220;speed AND comfort&#8221;?  Your alt is where you escape.  No drama, no whining, no complaints about the loot or the raid schedule, no requests to help Soandso&#8217;s brother with the jailbreak from Blackrock Depths (an odious quest, by the way), no requests for loans, and no inane conversations that start off with &#8220;hi.  how was your day?&#8221; because I always know where that convo is going &#8230; straight into how their day was.</p>
<p>And allow me to save you the pain of thinking you can tell a few people in the guild who your super-secret alt is and they won&#8217;t bust you at the worst moment possible &#8230; they will.  I know.  This is how it&#8217;ll go:  Guild says, we need another whatever-class for this BRD jailbreak for Soandso&#8217;s brother, does anyone know when Foton will be online?  Guild-idiot-I-thought-I-could-trust says, he&#8217;s online right now.  Guild says, where, we don&#8217;t see him.  Guild-idiot says, he&#8217;s on his warlock NotFoton&#8217;sWarlock.  </p>
<p>Next thing I knew, I&#8217;m getting tells from guildmates asking if that was my new warlock.  Fuck no, this is my new mage, your /who command is whacked.</p>
<p>And it was all downhill from there.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>The seed money and full backpacks is a must. Also, since I play the AH a tad, I keep an eye out for good deals on items for my alts and buy them ahead of when I need them, so I&#8217;m not stuck paying top dollar at the last minute. I just stash &#8217;em in the bank until I&#8217;m ready.</p>
<p>I do actually have one character with mining and herbalism. There&#8217;s some odd bug I&#8217;m experiencing that allows me to see both dots on my minimap at once if I have herbalism up. (I originally decided to do it before knowing of the bug, because at this point I have most resource nodes marked in Gatherer, so I know where to look for things and when to switch my detection sense over.) Hell no I won&#8217;t be reporting that bug! 😛</p>
<p>It&#8217;s definitely nice to have an alt that isn&#8217;t guilded, purely for relaxation. like s4dfish though I have that on another server, since I&#8217;ve run out of room on mine (or rather, I&#8217;m saving two slots for Draenei).</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>I was thinking about alts the other day &#8211; particularly the cunning ones. Surely someone will invent an addon that can allow you to track when a member of your guild goes offline and examines the Ironforge logons within the next two minutes? Said addon could collate said information over a period of time, and perhaps eventually allow you to spot your moonlighting guildies&#8230;</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Payment for signing a guild charter can be a really nice money boost for a new character who doesn&#8217;t have a main on that server&#8230;.  I&#8217;ll often help out people get a guild started (if I&#8217;m on an unguilded alt), if they&#8217;re polite, especially if they&#8217;re offering any payment.  The charters thrown up in my face, though, get declined and the guy ignored if he tries it again.</p>
<p>The other day, I was grinding when a guildie mentioned someone was trying to get signitures for a guild called &#8216;Fellowship of the Bling&#8217; &#8211; I thought that was such a good gag, it was worth switching over to an alt just to give them a signiture&#8230;</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Loved it, loved it.  I almost fell into the herbalism and mining trap, but before I trained either, the map thing occurred to me. So I went herbs and enchanting.  It&#8217;s an important point that the alt should feed the main, or at least a more advanced alt.  The herbs to go the Alchemist alt that feds back pots to main and newer alt.  Enchanting &#8211; or more correctly, DISenchanting, is pure profit.  I haven&#8217;t made back the return on investment from the first Enchanter on main.  I don&#8217;t have the time or the patience to spam enchants.  DE&#8217;g is the way to go.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>A glorious post indeed.  I thought I was the only one who created secret alts just to get away sometimes.  Not because I don&#8217;t like my friends.  But sometimes you just want to quest solo.</p>
<p>I wish I had learned the &#8220;don&#8217;t tell anyone about your secret identity&#8221; earlier than I did.  But you learn quick when the friend you <em>did </em>tell forgets you&#8217;re on your alt and ninja groups you both with the friend you <em>didn&#8217;t </em>tell.  Oops.</p>
