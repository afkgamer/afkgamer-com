					<description><![CDATA[Being a guild leader, I can truly appreciate this. ;) Speaking of Naxx though, I&#039;m currently trying to organize a raid through there, being that I&#039;m not a raid coordinator, would you or anyone else have any information on how to go about organizing a Naxx run? If so, please drop me an email. I was thrust into this position and I could use all the help I can get. *smiles*]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[...] I want to make sure to point out Nefbat&#8217;s Retroactively &#8216;New&#8217; Features. He just moved, so he couldn&#8217;t be here, but he made sure to send that over wrapped in a thermal pad. Good luck with that green monster, Blackguard! The Wizard of Duke Street has a tasty Comparison of WoW and EVE, and Tobold&#8217;s got a great big pile of Guild Management in World of Warcraft under that napkin over there. Brent brought some of the Almighty /Tell he made for VirginWorlds last month. Hmm &#8230; smells good too. What did you do, put it in a ziplock baggie? Nice. Then we have Foton, who brought us &#8230; &#8216;If This is Wednesday This Must Be Naxxramas&#8216;? Naxx? Foton, you brought Naxx to a Christmas dinner instead of yams? Jeez. I know you&#8217;re a non-traditionalist, but c&#8217;mon. [...]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ahh drama. I was reminded today while talking to someone from another online community I used to be a part of that drama is hardly unique to warcraft guilds--any place where people gather online has its drama. It&#039;s just far more entertaining in WoW. :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Foton  Reminds me of a story that occurred on our server a while back. A guy from one of our top guilds sold his account on eBay (Warrior - tier 2/3 mix of gear). However, just after he sold his account he had a problem with his internet connection and thus couldn&#039;t inform the guild that he&#039;d sold his account. This issue continued for just over a week.

The guild noticed something wrong when they reached C&#039;thun (duh, a n00b managed to tank his way to C&#039;thun???). Anyway apparently the guy was not known for being a TS talker, he only listened. So the n00b just went silent while the rest of the raid proceeded with the normal &#039;wtf?&#039; and &#039;is xxx afk?&#039;. Apparently in and out of raids the new guy had been pretending to be his predecessor.  

A week later (they raid 6 days a week), the account seller managed to get on to the guild website to inform them of the news. Obviously they kicked his immediately even though he begged for a trial. A few days pass and everyone has forgotten about another bought account. Until he applied to Uber Guild #2:

Previous Guilds: Uber Guild #1

Raiding Experience: All of BWL, AQ40 cleared up to and including C&#039;thun.

The funny thing is, he hadn&#039;t lied in his application!!]]></description>
