					<description><![CDATA[Not sure if you see old comments, but had to write.  Found your site today and have been reading your favorites.  This one made me laugh out loud so hard.  

The problem?  I am in a library.

The bigger problem?  I am the librarian.

Thanks for making me disturb 25 high school summer school students.  Ah hell, they are distubed long before they got to me...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I once ran a business &quot;Sidekicks Inc&quot; where people paid my female gnome 1 gold to be their sidekick for an hour. I&#039;d run around with them and /yell rhymes I made up bout how great they are. (yeah i&#039;m on an RP server) Mainly people that kind of knew me paid me not strangers.

Anyway one guy, male dwarf, asked me: &quot;Do you have any boy gnomes? I can dress him up in [Green Shirt]&quot; I said no it&#039;s just me. I could not get him to hire me he said he wanted a boy. So I forget about it. A week later he whispers me &quot;Do you have any boy gnomes yet?&quot; 

That was the only time I was really creepd out by someone.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I normally make the ugliest toon I can, but my little girl likes to make pretty human female toons.  So I&#039;ve been playing one as a priest alt.  I&#039;m in the SW AH and some guy /says to me, &quot;Wow, you&#039;re hot.  Take off your clothes and dance for me, and I&#039;ll give you 10G.&quot;  Jeezus Christ.  &quot;Hell no, go away.&quot;  So then he opens a trade window and tries to give me 5G.  Should have taken his money then cussed him.  Then again, he probably would have liked it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Y&#039;know, I gotta say. I played alliance, I played horde. I played USA, Oceania and now euro /english servers.

And they are all as childish and dumb as each other.

I find it&#039;s best to turn off general and lfg until at least 40. After 40, on both sides, things get more manageable. And I refuse to instance PUG before SM these days.]]></description>
