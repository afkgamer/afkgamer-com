					<description><![CDATA[I just LOVED the raid leader monotone toward the end. It was dead-on perfect. (I&#039;m not a raider myself--not good for my hands--but I&#039;ve listened to the Vent conversation on a couple of occasions when my husband&#039;s gone raiding.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I talked to a non-WOW, non-gaming person today about the episode and his opinion ... he could follow the gaming stuff, (altho the language was still a mishmash of gibberish), and thought it was hilarious.  

I think tho, between you and me, that he thought there was more hyperbole there than reality.  We know the truth, however.  :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Do you think you had to be a WOW player to get just how funny it was?  It was so surreal seeing how others might perceive our game-play.  It excited me about WOW but before I indulged in the urge to log-on, I realized that we all might need some help and elected to read the forums instead. LOL]]></description>
