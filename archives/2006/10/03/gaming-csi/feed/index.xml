					<description><![CDATA[Ahh the drama. Ahh the misery. Ahh the innocence lost.

Nice detective work. And please, do keep up the soap opera tales. This is great reading. I hope you do other writing as well besides blogging--you have a really strong style.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hmm was this recent? and alliance side?
because last week someone posted a warning in our server forums that a guild banker who had stolen everything from his guild was transferring, but didn&#039;t give the name, just that it was an anime-like name. So most of the &quot;top&quot; raiding guilds are on the lookout now when going over thir applicants. The server he&#039;s transferring from is there ... well I don&#039;t remember it now.
Unless this is more common than we thought.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The cross server transfers have added so much to the game in terms of drama possibilities.  I know of a former guild leader with a huge guild bank who was going to transfer to a guild that he had been dreaming of joining since he played EQ.  He promised to distribute it to the members but didn&#039;t do so.  When a thread was made on the general forums listing the guild&#039;s assets (HUGE), he transferred most of it to a reformed guild which contained a handful of the former members.  The fact that he was in a high profile guild put some pressure on the situation.

Before the anonymous server transfers, a person would be unable to make use of a character that had stolen a guild bank.  I think we can see much more of this type of behavior in the future.  I can&#039;t think of a great way to safeguard against it.  My guild has banks on several accounts, and several people have access to the information.  I hope it doesn&#039;t ever happen in my guild, but there is an entertainment factor to reading about such happenings elsewhere.  Nice detective work.  =)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Obviously not.

EDIT:  But you&#039;re welcome to guess in an email and I can lie to you there.  :)  Any guesses about my secret identity made in comments here will be, and have always been, deleted.  I understand completely that the punishment for telling tales out of school will be:  guildremoval and exposure of my WoW accounts to &quot;reprisals&quot;.  ]]></description>
