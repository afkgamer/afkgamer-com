					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for bringing back good memories. The froglok king was an awesome camp. I can&#039;t claim server first killing of him, but my small guild did routinely single-group him at a time when most folks (on our server, at least) said it was impossible with fewer than 2 groups. That was cool stuff.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Sarge
The design for EQ, originally, looked for more of the &quot;do something new and have a fun adventure while exploring&quot; attitude than a &quot;Overcome the challenge of encounter X&quot;. Honestly, there weren&#039;t even what many would consider &quot;boss&quot; mobs in the game upon release. There were rare spawn mobs that were harder than the others and like 2-3 real boss mobs at the end of the harder level 50 dungeons. The challenge came in getting to the bosses, being lucky enough to have them up at the time and getting a clean pull off. Oh, and hoping that some group wasn&#039;t already there and killing him. It was just a different kind of challenge, especially since you were limited to such a small group size.

We didn&#039;t get to see a plethora of real boss encounters until the Ruins of Kunark expansion and places like Karnor&#039;s Castle.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice story but just to clarify. This &quot;server first&quot; kill he talks about. It would appear they downed him on their first attempt? That&#039;s a bit shit isn&#039;t it. Compaired to WoW, I can&#039;t imagine 40 guys wondering into AQ40 and stumbling across Twin Emps or C&#039;thun and saying &quot;wow that was tough we lost 5 guys. Yeah we got him though.&quot; and &quot;hey guys, I&#039;ve just looted this eye thingy, anyone know what it does?&quot;

I&#039;ve never played EQ but I have heard about the whole corpse run sitch. But if the bosses are this easy, then I would probably prefer the progression raid runs when you wipe every 20 minutes over and over again until you get it right.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great story. A real shame that the rise of t&#039;internet brings with it a sharing of knowledge that severely damages the things the core element of these online games as they operate now - the sense of adventure and unknowing.

In my lifetime I hope to see a game that can continually surprise and be wildly unpredictable, and yet provide a cohesive and fun journey.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, I thought perhaps you had finally given up on WoW and came back to EQII.  I dumped WoW so long ago.  A friend and I got fed up with the leftovers of other MMOs and finally wandered back to EQII.  Ah... oh well.  It is refreshing though to see some of the things that have been added to EQII while WoW still struggles to get its *first* expansion out.  I&#039;d hate to say it but SOE has innovated a little bit..... even enough to make it kinda fun.]]></description>
