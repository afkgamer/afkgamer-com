					<description><![CDATA[i don&#039;t see why everyone complains about the aq gates as &#039;being a first.&#039; if they missed out on their server, there are plenty other servers that will be completing the same thing sometime soon and it won&#039;t be any different. yes, i&#039;m sure i&#039;d be a lil upset about missing it, but if u have a rl friend who&#039;s watching it, then go over to their place and watch it instead of getting frustrated about not getting in. really, complaining about blizz or other ppl taking your spot is not going to do anything at all. that&#039;s about all i have to say. glad my servers gates won&#039;t open any time soon. g&#039;bye all.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oye people!

I&#039;ve watched many, many hours of this drug-like game and can half understand your level of addiction.  However, it is only a game.  Witnessing a &quot;first&quot; is not the end of the world, a digital world at that!  You should all take a vacation and chill.

					<description><![CDATA[Y&#039;see, when you use adjectives and other descriptors well out of proportion with your argument, then you blow credibility, e.g.  the Medivh invasion is a reflection of societal moral decay.  C&#039;mon man, you can do better than that.

You are right about this much -- I do not care.  I was there to get a story:  the mass influx of tourist alts to witness Medivh&#039;s AQ War Effort completion, what the GMs and Blizzard would do, what the residents would do and what the tourists would do.  I even took various measures to ensure that I would get the story because I could tell, it was gonna be good.  

I don&#039;t care about the one guy that was in a queue because I was online.  I don&#039;t care about the dialup people that lagged because my cow reporter was visible on their screen.  I was there to get and I got. 

The next time there&#039;s a freakish gathering on a server, I&#039;ll probably be there too.  And I&#039;ll take similar measures to ensure that I&#039;m there to get.  I won&#039;t care about Jimmy in the login queue and I won&#039;t care about Sally on dialup.

But I do so enjoy real life crusaders, who weren&#039;t there, that try to lecture me about griefing and server performance at a public online event in a public area.  Now that shit gives me wood.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In case you haven&#039;t noticed, this is an MMO blog, and has been focused on WoW for some time now.  What happened to Medivh is MMO News.  Every other major MMO blog out there covered this event to some extent, and Foton took it one step further by actually covering the event from ground zero.  

This is the kind of crack reporting work that keeps me coming back here day after day, and I would expect nothing less from the staff at AFKGamer. Hundreds if not thousands of people flooded the Medivh server to get in on the hysteria surrounding the first server to open the gates.  At least Foton took the time to document the happenings on the server, and was able to provide his readers with an entertaining account of what went down.

Coming here and acting like he&#039;s responsible for the decline of western civilization because he joined the hunderds of other people who flooded Medivh is retarded, and in fact, the only reason I didn&#039;t try to make a character there and check it out for myself is because I read about what was happening here and knew that I didn&#039;t have to.  I wouldn&#039;t be suprised if the posts on this blog actually saved you guys a few queue spots.  And regardless of what you say, Blizzard was only entity in a position to do anything about it and of course they dropped the ball.  I know you can&#039;t stand to hear that, but they are the one&#039;s who fucked up, the author of this blog.

People on Warsong have been bitching about the same exact god damn thing since battlegrounds came out, we&#039;ve been dealing with the shit that Medivh put up with for a few days for over half a year, and every time we bitch people tell us to STFU.  

Welcome to the internet, cry more.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[this is a reflection of our crap for crap no accountability society in general.
&quot;if you&#039;re mad blame blizz, etc....&quot;
PLEASE........you spineless, no honor, insensitive loser.
Have some accountability for your actions.
Yes blizz should address the server issues, but the fact is you KNEW you would be taking away from the experience of those who earned it.
There is NO excuse for your actions other than selfishness, end of story......flame me all you want, but there is no other point of view.
you are selfish people for doing so, and if the roles were reversed, I&#039;d love to see how you would feel. &quot;oh, i would understand cause I know about Ques&quot; is prolly what you would say. This forum talk has made it easy for you to say things like that, because you wwill never have to be accountable for what you say on here. and we all know you would pissed if you spent the time and effort to do something like this and you missed it do to someone&#039;s blatent disreguard for you.

bottom line is you knew people that had worked for this would be affected in a negative way by your actions, and you chose to do so in spite of that.

i am NOT from that server, i just had to post based on my general disgust.

					<description><![CDATA[Anyone who&#039;s played Wow knows about the queues.  They&#039;ve been around since the first week the game was out.  People show up en masse to a realm -- you get queues.  This was not a surprise to anyone.

It&#039;s fairly obvious that EVERY person who created an alt KNEW THIS.  And THEY KNEW they were putting people who had worked on the event into the queues.  We asked on the forums for people to refrain from creating alts.  They didn&#039;t.  We asked them in game to refrain.  They didn&#039;t.  GMs ported people.  They came back.

Even if they weren&#039;t trying to crash the servers, they were preventing people from orchestrating the event from getting onto the realm.  Medivhians had queues upwards of 2 hours.  Some who had spent hundreds of hours moving materials from one side to another never got to see the end.  Why should your &quot;peoplewatching&quot; prevent those who actually worked from seeing the end result?

Look, we wanted everyone in Wow to see the results, but that just isn&#039;t possible.  In lieu of this we&#039;re offering screenshots, videos, etc.  Respect our requests to stay off our realm so the people who worked hard to get here can actually see the finale.]]></description>
