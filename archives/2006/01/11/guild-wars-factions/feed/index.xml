					<description><![CDATA[The Ritualist&#039;s Primary Attribute is related to spirit-summoning. They are said to be like Necromancers (have minions -- in this case, spirits), Rangers (can summon spirits), and Monks (have access to healing spells). I guess they are sort of like Shamans. Apparently the Ritualist was created partially to take the pressure off of Monks, though from the few details available they do seem to have quite a few unique abilities. Already I can think of a few complementary Professions.]]></description>
