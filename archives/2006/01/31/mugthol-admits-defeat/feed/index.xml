					<description><![CDATA[Archimonde is underpopulated from &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-general&amp;t=6816299&amp;tmp=1#post6816299&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the recent evacuation &lt;strong&gt;to&lt;/strong&gt; Mug&#039;thol&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We will be opening character transfers for the 8 realms listed below today at 3:00 AM. Characters on these realms will be able to transfer to the new PvP realm, Mug&#039;thol. This round of transfers will be open Monday through Friday from 3:00 AM to 3:00 PM PST until Wednesday, February 1 at 3:00 PM PST. Please be aware that until the transfer window is closed, standard character creation will be unavailable on this realm.

Archimonde
Mannoroth
Warsong
Bleeding Hollow
Skullcrusher
Azgalor
Burning Blade
Burning Legion&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Originally, some PVE and RP realms were going to be allowed onto Mug&#039;thol also and they realized that probably wasn&#039;t appropriate and limited Mug&#039;thol to PVP evacuees only.

It&#039;s really hard to keep up.  People come and go so quickly around here.]]></description>
