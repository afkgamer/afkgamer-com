					<description><![CDATA[I must have missed this one back in the day, but since it&#039;s already been necro&#039;d might as well comment on it looking back at what he said one year later.

Still waiting for some of that casual stuff he mentioned aren&#039;t we? :D

- Characters follow a new quest line to obtain an armor set

hmmmm nope
- The armor sets contain 4 rare and 4 epic pieces

still nope
- Some of the pieces can be obtained by soloing (including one of the epic pieces)

nope again
- The most difficult pieces to obtain require a UBRS level group

ahahahahaha
- We are adding new bosses to existing dungeons

AHAHAHAHAHAHA
- Some of the existing dungeons are being re-itemized

And I just died.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;I hate you tigole, i hope you fucking die, you ruined this game for us, by adding your dumbass little 40 man content...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

LOL

Nail. on. the. head.

I can&#039;t wait until all the millions of players who are new to MMOs (including me)  find that next FUN game (that is right on the horizon), and promptly fuck right off without so much as a look over the shoulder. 

Blizzard: Your 16 y/o raid whores will not keep your company afloat, now that you have gotten used to the big money. Casual gamers (a.k.a. players with JOBS and LIVES) are your bread and butter. So best get your asses ready for the time when a true ROLEPLAYING game comes along.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[heh.  I know a hardcore pvp horde named Korgath on my server.  I hate that bastard ... cuz he&#039;s schooled me a few times.  I&#039;ve given him a lesson or two as well, but frankly, it&#039;s probably gear wtfpwning him which proves your point amply.

p.s.  Tigole isn&#039;t Fires of Heaven, that&#039;s Furor.  Tigole is from another EQ Glory Days guild, but ... same diff.]]></description>
