					<description><![CDATA[I happened to stumble on this site from Grumpy Gamer&#039;s site when I noticed this post on the Lunar Festival.  I just have to give kudos to Blizzard for adding that little mail message from the elders that you&#039;ve visited with Lucky Red Envelopes.  This comes very close to the Chinese New Year tradition of giving out lai-see (lucky money in red envelopes).

Even though there seems to be a lot of added lag, this has definitely been an interesting event.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bit more on this topic, if you&#039;re looking to get additional coin rewards beyond the obvious 5 near major flightpaths, &lt;a href=&quot;http://thottbot.com/?i=52678&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;thottbot has some good posts&lt;/a&gt; on coin elder locations with specific locs and narratives to find the elders.  (The &lt;a href=&quot;http://thottbot.com/?ccb=1&amp;v=454153&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;post by jtoebes&lt;/a&gt; is particularly helpful -- he recommends  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wowwiki.com/Elders&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this list at the WoW wiki&lt;/a&gt;.)

There are 50 coins in total, and while I won&#039;t be collecting all 50, as long as I&#039;m passing by an elder, might as well grab a coin.

Most coins (even in hostile/cross-factioned areas) can be collected without combat, although it doesn&#039;t hurt to be a sneaking rogue or dr00d.

EDIT:  My comment about hostile/cross-factioned areas is applicable to PvE servers only.  Those PvP realm people have additional challenges to collecting coins, OBVIOUSLY.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One of the best things about this quest, for a low level character, is the ability to pick up the Darnassus (for human/dwarf/gnome) flightpoints or IF/Stormwind flightpoints (for night elves) without the suicide run through the Wetlands.  And even for somewhat higher levels, getting the flight path for Moonglade before your forties (non-druids) is nice.

The alliance reputation given for each coin received is nice, and a major incentive for me and probably quite a few others.  I love these bonus holiday type quests that give reputation rewards.

Never go on an adventure without a hat!

					<description><![CDATA[Ya, that&#039;s true, it&#039;s mad mad mad exp for very little effort.  Considering that, plus the kinky rewards and the lunar decorations, these special events are truly what Blizzard does best.

@Troggdor -- Great video link.  Watched it twice, lol&#039;d each time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One of the best things about this is that if you do the basic quest to visit Moonglade for the festival (throw 10 fireworks, get the teleport scroll, talk to a guy in Moonglade) you get about 4800xp. Even if you are level 5! All my lowbie alts just made 1 or 2 levels for just the 4 silver that the fireworks cost.]]></description>
