					<description><![CDATA[i think Zul&#039;gurub was a good idea gone wrong.

The trash is too frequent (and too strong... some of the trash pulls are the hardest in the zone) and the idea about progressive boss strengh would be grand if you could just SKIP the shitty bosses.

My guild would run ZG with 2 raids probably if you could skip the aspects without punishment. Just do Jindo/Bloodlord/Hakkar run. Takes about 2h and has decent enough loot.
But no, we have to spend ~8h in the zone to waste the trash aspects]]></description>
