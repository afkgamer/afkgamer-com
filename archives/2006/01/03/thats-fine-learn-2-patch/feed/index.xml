					<description><![CDATA[No idea where to reliably find archives of the For Really patch notes, I read it on my guild website as I was downloading (usually by the time I get home from work someone has a mirror up), and confirmed it by reading the notes as it installed.

I suppose I should note that SnD now supposedly can trigger Ruthlessness.  So overall probably a net gain for rogues this patch.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Foton, every patch notes I can google up agrees with you, but I think those are carried over from the test client notes and when it went live yesterday the ACTUAL notes had different info on the troll racial beserking.  I didn&#039;t have a chance to test it, but I know this is so relevant to you alliance types I just have to post.

As I recall:
Scales from 10-30% haste depending on your hp when activated
No longer requires being crit
Requires energy/rage/mana
3 min cooldown instead of 2

In other words, I might actually use it, possibly every cooldown depending on the energy cost.

Also in the world of rogues, no more SnD on dead mobs, and our Tier 2 set received the only nerf in the form of decreased proc rate from the 8 item bonus, although I&#039;m also hearing that it now crits based on your base crit % instead of 5% and so the damage stayed about even.  Not that there&#039;s a large population with 8 piece Bloodfang, but I have to ask who decided that proc rate was causing rogues to be overpowered.]]></description>

But the big news really - three cheers for the arrival of economic meltdown in WoW! :

					<description><![CDATA[Ain&#039;t updates fun?

Truthfully tho, being an employer in the software industry (not gaming tho) it boggles my head to think about having to maintain a system that went from 0 to 5 mil users in a year.  The bandwidth requirements are crazy (and btw, with correct firewall configs I was getting the download at over 50K/s, not too bad) and WOW the number of servers they must have to maintain...

Of course there are bugs in a new release - they test as much as they can, but there is a point you have to let the code loose, and players/users ALWAYS find bugs.  As long as they get fixed quickly (within a week or two is quickly in coding context), that&#039;s what counts.

Perhaps it&#039;s just because I&#039;m a new player to World of Warcraft (just got it for Christmas), but I feel like sayin&#039; &quot;Don&#039;t Bag On Blizzard&quot; :)  They&#039;re doing the best they can in a very very stressful environment.  

They must have a billion new employees just for the WoW project, and it always takes new people about 6-12 months to really &#039;gel&#039; with the company and be a productive asset.  Again, my head is boggling, LOL!
