		<p>The long awaited <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/patchnotes.html">Warcraft patch 1.9.0</a>, aka Life Just Got a Whole Lot Easier for Paladins, was released today.  (That link won&#8217;t last as Blizzard doesn&#8217;t believe in permalinks.  But how nice am I?  I cut and paste the whole thing for you after the jump so we can mock this some day and use it as evidence in our class action suit.)</p>
<p>You know how Blizzard&#8217;s patcher is with firewalls, fictional firewalls, routers and that fancy schmancy broadband some folks have nowadays &#8212; not too cooperative &#8212; so start patching ASAP.  Then download all your mod updates.  Then pray that the login servers hold up tonight.  Then just give up and go to bed.</p>
<p>Speaking of their ratass patcher, how hard is it to provide adequate patching bandwidth when they&#8217;re charging everyone 15 and change every month to play the game?  Fercrissakes, set aside 25 cents from each subscription and buy some patching power.</p>
<p>Cheap bastards.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>  Reporting live from the scene of my Warcraft server, Raster (blog servant) has <acronym title="instant messaged">IM&#8217;d</acronym> that the in-game mail system is currently broken and there are numerous errors with the &#8220;improved&#8221; (ironic quotes added for emphasis) Auction House system.  Raster added this commentary:  lol.  (Confirmation of email and AH problems in <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-general&#038;t=6517190">this Blizzard forum message</a>.)</p>
<p>Damn.  Stuck at work and I wanted to lol too.</p>
<p><span id="more-822"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Live Patch Notes Disclaimer: While we make every effort to include all upcoming changes in our patch notes, please be aware that occasionally some changes are unintentionally omitted.</p>
<p><strong>World of Warcraft Client Patch 1.9.0 (2006-1-3)</strong></p>
<p>The Gates of Ahn&#8217;Qiraj</p>
<p>      The Gates of Ahn&#8217;Qiraj will house two massive, unique dungeons &#8212; the Ruins of Ahn&#8217;Qiraj, a 20-man raid dungeon, and the Temple of Ahn&#8217;Qiraj, a 40-man raid dungeon. As players delve deeper into the mysteries of Ahn&#8217;Qiraj, they will discover revelations of the Silithid infestation and their shadowy masters, the Qiraji. Players will have to complete a world event of massive proportions before they can open the Gates of Ahn&#8217;Qiraj on their realm. </p>
<p>Linked Auction Houses</p>
<p>      Players will now be able to buy and sell goods with greater effectiveness using the Linked Auction House system. Auction Houses in Orgrimmar, Undercity, and Thunder Bluff will now share the same pool of Horde player-created auctions, and Alliance players will find the same to be true when visiting Ironforge, Stormwind City, and Darnassus Auction Houses. This system has been expanded to support the neutral Auction Houses as well. Tanaris, Everlook, and Booty Bay will all be linked for players of both factions to access. In addition, the &#8220;Looking for Group&#8221; and &#8220;Trade&#8221; channels have been unified among the corresponding cities, meaning, for example, that you can trade your goods or look for groups in Ironforge while in Stormwind. </p>
<p>Multiple Battlegrounds Queues</p>
<p>      Players will be able to enter multiple battleground queues. No longer must you make the hard decision of which queue to join &#8212; when queued for all three, you can join the first one available or hold out for that particular battleground which you&#8217;ve really got your heart set on. </p>
<p>Soul Shard Bags</p>
<p>      Tailors now can make soul bags to hold soul shards. The smallest is a 20-slot bag, the recipe for which can be purchased in Gadgetzan. The recipe for a larger bag can be found in Scholomance, and one for an even larger bag can be found in Molten Core. In the main UI, these soul bags will display how many shards they contain. So long as the soul bags have room, any soul shards a warlock creates will automatically go into the bag. </p>
<p>Raid Calendar System</p>
<p>      The raid-lockout system has undergone a significant change. The new system will have all instances reset at a certain server time, regardless of when you were actually saved to the instance. The reset schedule is as follows:<br />
      Molten Core: Every 7 Days, resetting during weekly maintenance.<br />
      Blackwing Lair: Every 7 Days, resetting during weekly maintenance<br />
      Onyxia: Every 5 Days<br />
      Zul&#8217;Gurub: Every 3 Days<br />
      Temple of Ahn&#8217;Qiraj (40-man): Every 7 Days, resetting during weekly maintenance<br />
      Ruins of Ahn&#8217;Qiraj (20-man): Every 3 Days<br />
      All resets will occur during off-hours, when the least amount of raids are active. </p>
<p>Important Note for Mac OS X Users</p>
<p>      The minimum supported Mac OS X revision for WoW will be changed in a post-1.9.0 patch, from 10.3.5 to 10.3.9. If you are running 10.3.5 &#8211; 10.3.8 and need to get the free update, you can use Software Update or you can click here for the direct download. This change will make it easier for us to release future updates to the game, for example to support upcoming Mac models based on Intel processors. </p>
<p>General</p>
<p>    * All Disorient effects have been renamed Incapacitate effects. This includes Gouge, Sap, etc.<br />
    * All Confusion effects have been renamed Disorient effects. This includes Blind, Scatter Shot, etc.<br />
    * Food and Drink are now in separate categories, so you can only have one food effect and one drink effect on you at a time. The only effect should be that foods that used to stack with each other (you could have two food effects on you at once) no longer will stack.<br />
    * On-next-swing abilities will no longer cause multiple weapon procs on a single swing. </p>
<p>PvP</p>
<p>    * Several civilian NPCs, who previously would assist non-civilians, will no longer do so. </p>
<p>Druids</p>
<p>    * Bear and Dire Bear form &#8211; Effects that lower armor will now lower armor by a percentage of the druid&#8217;s full armor, rather than just base (caster form) armor. However, Enrage will still only remove 75% of base armor.<br />
    * Omen of Clarity &#8211; Special attacks will no longer consume their own clearcasting state. All melee attacks will now be able to trigger the clearcasting state.<br />
    * Nature&#8217;s Grasp &#8211; This spell can now trigger from special melee attacks. It will no longer be possible to cast Entangling Roots at no mana cost immediately after Nature&#8217;s Grasp procs.<br />
    * Nature&#8217;s Grace &#8211; The Nature&#8217;s Grace buff will now appear on the player upon completion of casting, before the travel time of the spell. So, Wrath crits will now benefit the casting time of the next spell cast.<br />
    * Insect Swarm &#8211; New icon.<br />
    * Improved Starfire &#8211; The stun effect&#8217;s duration no longer diminishes or is diminished by controlled stun abilities and spells (e.g. Cheap Shot, Hammer of Justice, Charge etc.).<br />
    * Omen of Clarity &#8211; This spell now works correctly with Bash, Rip, Ferocious Bite, and Demoralizing Roar, granting a decrease in the cost of the ability. Ferocious Bite will still use the entire energy bar to generate additional damage. </p>
<p>Hunters</p>
<p>    * Arcane Shot &#8211; This spell can no longer trigger twice in one shot off of the Paladin&#8217;s Judgement of Wisdom.<br />
    * Aspect of the Pack and Aspect of the Cheetah &#8211; Periodic damage will no longer trigger the Dazed effect.<br />
    * Aspect of the Wild &#8211; Radius increased. Tooltip updated to display radius.<br />
    * Improved Concussive Shot &#8211; The stun effect&#8217;s duration no longer diminishes or is diminished by controlled stun abilities and spells (e.g. Cheap Shot, Hammer of Justice, Charge etc.).<br />
    * Tame Beast &#8211; The hunter will now turn to face the target during the taming process.<br />
    * Bestial Wrath &#8211; Damage bonus reduced, duration increased.<br />
    * Unleashed Fury &#8211; Damage bonus increased.<br />
    * Pet Changes<br />
          o Turtles can now eat raw and cooked fish.<br />
          o Turtles can now learn Shell Shield, allowing them to reduces all damage taken by 50% for 10 sec.<br />
          o Hunters can now tame Sons of Hakkar. Sons of Hakkar are in the Wind Serpent family and will know Lightning Breath (Rank 6).<br />
          o Boars can now learn Charge, an ability that allows them to charge to an enemy, immobilize that enemy for 1 second, and add a large amount of Attack Power to the boar&#8217;s next attack.<br />
          o Gorillas can now learn Thunderstomp, an ability that causes high threat area Nature damage. </p>
<p>Mages</p>
<p>    * Impact &#8211; The stun effect&#8217;s duration no longer diminishes or is diminished by controlled stun abilities and spells (e.g. Cheap Shot, Hammer of Justice, Charge etc.).<br />
    * Netherwind Regalia &#8211; The 8-piece set bonus will now proc immediately upon completion of casting the spell, before travel time on the spell. This will allow the proc to affect the next spell cast as intended.<br />
    * Arcane Concentration &#8211; Blizzard will now be able to gain a Clearcasting state from this talent.<br />
    * Blast Wave &#8211; Will now show spell data in the talent page. </p>
<p>Paladins</p>
<p>    * Due to significant talent changes, all Paladins&#8217; talent points will be refunded and can be respent. Training costs for all talent spell/ability replacements have been significantly reduced.<br />
    * Paladins can now learn Greater Blessings for the following spells:<br />
          o Blessing of Might<br />
          o Blessing of Wisdom<br />
          o Blessing of Kings<br />
          o Blessing of Sanctuary<br />
          o Blessing of Salvation<br />
      Greater Blessings will cast the associated blessing on all raid members that share the same class as the target. For example, if you cast Greater Blessing of Might on a warrior in your raid, all warriors in the raid party will receive Blessing of Might from you. Additionally, Greater Blessings have an increased duration of 15 minutes. These blessings require twice as much mana as the single target version, as well as a reagent. Paladins can purchase these new Greater Blessing spells from their class trainers.<br />
    * Seal of Fury &#8211; The seal and judgement have been removed and replaced with a new self-buff, Righteous Fury, which will increase threat from holy damage.<br />
    * Seals and Judgements &#8211; Added or increased damage per level so that these spells keep pace between replacements.<br />
    * Judgements &#8211; Judgements that place a debuff on their victim will now all have their duration refreshed when the judging paladin strikes the victim with his or her melee swings. All these debuffs have had their duration decreased to 10 seconds. In addition, Judgements that place debuffs can no longer be resisted.<br />
    * Seal of Righteousness &#8211; Now does holy damage on every swing. It can now proc correctly as well. The Judgement effect has been renamed &#8220;Judgement of Righteousness&#8221; to differentiate it from the Seal damage in the combat log.<br />
    * Judgement of the Crusader &#8211; The holy damage bonus has been decreased as part of rebalancing paladin damage (which is still increased overall).<br />
    * Seal of Command &#8211; The proc will occur more often, but will only do 70% of weapon-swing damage.<br />
    * Judgement of Command &#8211; Instead of placing a debuff on the victim, this spell now does immediate damage. If the victim is not stunned, they only take 30% of the total damage. The damage on this Judgement was increased significantly.<br />
    * Judgement of Wisdom &#8211; Arcane Shot will no longer cause this to proc twice on one shot. Channeling spells can now trigger this proc as well.<br />
    * Vengeance &#8211; Special ability critical hits can now trigger Vengeance.<br />
    * Judgement of Righteousness &#8211; The damage of this judgement was increased significantly. This judgement can now trigger procs.<br />
    * Holy Shock &#8211; Now heals friendly targets and damages enemy targets. Mana cost reduced. Bonus from spell damage and healing items increased.<br />
    * All Seals and Judgements have had their bonus coefficient from plus spell damage re-evaluated. Some holy damage effects had no coefficient before and now have a coefficient.<br />
    * Vengeance &#8211; Clarified the tooltip to indicate procs will not trigger Vengeance.<br />
    * Summon Warhorse &#8211; Mana cost reduced.<br />
    * Summon Charger &#8211; Mana cost reduced.<br />
    * Consecration &#8211; No longer displays a debuff icon on targets in the area of effect.<br />
    * Updated Aura tooltips to be more clear (include radius, fix grammatical errors etc&#8230;).<br />
    * Judgement &#8211; Range increased, cooldown decreased, mana cost decreased. Using Judgement will now initiate melee combat.<br />
    * Exorcism &#8211; Now usable on Demon targets in addition to Undead targets.<br />
    * Holy Wrath &#8211; Now usable on Demon targets in addition to Undead targets.<br />
    * Seal of Justice &#8211; Mana cost slightly increased. The stun effect&#8217;s duration no longer diminishes or is diminished by controlled stun abilities and spells (e.g. Cheap Shot, Hammer of Justice, Charge etc&#8230;).<br />
    * Seal of Righteousness &#8211; Damage bonus from +Holy damage items increased, mana cost slightly increased.<br />
    * Seal of Command &#8211; Damage bonus from +Holy damage items increased.<br />
    * Seal of the Crusader &#8211; Mana cost slightly increased.<br />
    * Seal of Fury &#8211; Removed and replaced with Righteous Fury.<br />
    * Seal of Light &#8211; Mana cost slightly increased.<br />
    * Seal of Wisdom &#8211; Mana cost slightly increased.<br />
    * Seal of Command &#8211; Mana cost slightly increased.<br />
    * Hammer of Wrath &#8211; Missile speed of the flying hammer increased.<br />

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Ain&#8217;t updates fun?</p>
<p>Truthfully tho, being an employer in the software industry (not gaming tho) it boggles my head to think about having to maintain a system that went from 0 to 5 mil users in a year.  The bandwidth requirements are crazy (and btw, with correct firewall configs I was getting the download at over 50K/s, not too bad) and WOW the number of servers they must have to maintain&#8230;</p>
<p>Of course there are bugs in a new release &#8211; they test as much as they can, but there is a point you have to let the code loose, and players/users ALWAYS find bugs.  As long as they get fixed quickly (within a week or two is quickly in coding context), that&#8217;s what counts.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s just because I&#8217;m a new player to World of Warcraft (just got it for Christmas), but I feel like sayin&#8217; &#8220;Don&#8217;t Bag On Blizzard&#8221; 🙂  They&#8217;re doing the best they can in a very very stressful environment.  </p>
<p>They must have a billion new employees just for the WoW project, and it always takes new people about 6-12 months to really &#8216;gel&#8217; with the company and be a productive asset.  Again, my head is boggling, LOL!</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Foton, every patch notes I can google up agrees with you, but I think those are carried over from the test client notes and when it went live yesterday the ACTUAL notes had different info on the troll racial beserking.  I didn&#8217;t have a chance to test it, but I know this is so relevant to you alliance types I just have to post.</p>
<p>As I recall:<br />
Scales from 10-30% haste depending on your hp when activated<br />
No longer requires being crit<br />
Requires energy/rage/mana<br />
3 min cooldown instead of 2</p>
<p>In other words, I might actually use it, possibly every cooldown depending on the energy cost.</p>
<p>Also in the world of rogues, no more SnD on dead mobs, and our Tier 2 set received the only nerf in the form of decreased proc rate from the 8 item bonus, although I&#8217;m also hearing that it now crits based on your base crit % instead of 5% and so the damage stayed about even.  Not that there&#8217;s a large population with 8 piece Bloodfang, but I have to ask who decided that proc rate was causing rogues to be overpowered.</p>
