					<description><![CDATA[This story reminded me of that fumbling cybersex example that was floating around the web a few years back where the guy uses scissors to cut off the woman&#039;s clothes.  As I went to hunt down that link, which I believe I originally read on Something Awful, I ran across this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geeky-boy.com/fun/cyber1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;little bit of drama&lt;/a&gt; between the author of &quot;Realistic Cybersex&quot; and many of the sites that were running the piece (originally published in July 1996 Playboy?).

Anyways, you can find &quot;Realistic Cybersex&quot; all over the net with a Google, although I prefer this one since it appears unstaged and &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/afkgamer/91379665/&quot;&gt;Chet&#039;s screams&lt;/a&gt; of &quot;DO U KNOW WHO I AM? I AM IMPORTANT&quot; are priceless.]]></description>
