					<description><![CDATA[EQII had to get a strong and fast fix because until august it simply was not in the same league as wow. 
To be honest in my mind it still isn&#039;t. The game just doesnt feel right (and yes i had a subscription i still do today actually). It started out broken, and while SoE was willing to make changes, some of the common problems (like the way the game runs on mid-end PCs) are still around.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[EQII has come on leaps and bounds since I started as early back as July 05.  Constant updates, tweaks etc. but nothing that&#039;s put the game back, only moved it forward.  It also seems to be a more mature community, and if not mature, certainly friendly.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[They fixed rogue sneak.  You move fast--heck, everyone moves at perma-sprint speed now.

EQ2 isn&#039;t the same game that launched in November 2004, while WoW (arguably) hasn&#039;t changed significantly.  SOE has shown they&#039;re willing to rip out and monkey with mechanics, and in the case of EQ2, they made it a much more appealing game.]]></description>
