					<description><![CDATA[Haha.

I&#039;d suggest:  DELETE FROM characters WHERE class=&#039;hunter&#039;&amp;race=&#039;night elf&#039; but probably a million more would be created overnight to replace those, like cutting off one of a hydra&#039;s heads .. two more spring up to replace it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As long as Barrens chat is still seperate...

That was a necessary step else distributing Auction Houses would dilute the benefits LFG and trade reap from having a communal gathering point.  Having a community center is a good thing, and that is preserved with the exception of distrubuted geographics - not perfect since many interactions still require or are facilitated by proximity, but still not too bad.

Someone who&#039;s partaken of more game design koolaid might have to explain to me one more time why all towns can&#039;t be linked without the 10 minute flight time barrier, something about the illusion of size which I suspect may be another neolithic arbitrarily enforced artifical scarcity paradigm needing to be exposed as a crutch to dilute weak content and torn down.  Or else maybe I&#039;ll finally understand.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Regarding #3...

It&#039;ll be a lot easier to monitor chat now that all the major cities Trade, LFG, and General chats are connected.

Because, ya know, there wasn&#039;t enough spam in each city alone, so Blizzard lumped them all together... *eyeroll*]]></description>
