					<description><![CDATA[romp, that&#039;s exactly why the NPC gang members rock.  They aren&#039;t quite as stupid as real people.  Also, if you need to travel somewhere tough, you can bring them along as bait to feed the Char and when the action gets too hot just abandon them.  They tend not to curse at you in chat for that.  Although if you do find them cursing at you in chat, you either have a drinking problem or you didn&#039;t grab an NPC :-).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had forgotten how bad Guild Wars grouping was, been playing WoW so much lately. Shortly after making my monk and getting into a group for one of the early missions. Some Doofus ruined the bonus by aggroing the mobs before they can open the gate they are supposed to open. When he died he got mad at us for not being there to help him and tried to insist that the gate would open anyway, which it didn&#039;t, of course. At the end he started cursing us all out in party chat, called me an @$$hole and a bad healer (despite the fact that his zerg rush was the ONLY death and we killed all the Char, including the ones you were not supposed to kill because its &quot;too dangerous&quot; according to the mission). The other guys in the mission invited me to join their guild, so I must have been really bad at healing :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Man I&#039;ve played a warrior since release, and even though I wasn&#039;t part of that protest I remember thinking &quot;Good, I hope the server melts.&quot;

Remember how bad we used to suck?  No rage on dodge, parry, or block.  Overpower didn&#039;t proc off of specials.  What&#039;s that you say??  Your execute was parried?  Well that&#039;s too bad, I hope you didn&#039;t want that 70 rage cause it&#039;s gone fucker.

Even other classes were coming to our forums saying &quot;Hey, c&#039;mon help these guys out, it&#039;s embarrasing to watch them duel.&quot;

Once the Arc Reapers started rolling in people changed their tune pretty quick though didn&#039;t they?]]></description>
