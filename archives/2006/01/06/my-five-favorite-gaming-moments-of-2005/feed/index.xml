					<description><![CDATA[[...] Friday night was spent working to start up the first of these projects. The URL hasn&#8217;t caught up with all the DNS servers on the interweb yet. Of course, it&#8217;s hosted here on RD.net so I can point you directly at it. This project? MMOG Nation (mmognation.com, when the servers catch up). That name has been on the tip of my tongue for the last two years, ever since I realized that MMORPGDot wasn&#8217;t going to get me where I wanted to go. MMOG Nation is going to be a platform for my opinions and experiences playing Massively Multiplayer Online Games. I have to point fingers, though. Raph Koster and Foton were my instigators. Their writing over the last few months has been inspirational for me as a writer and a gamer. When I start sucking out loud, I know who to blame. [...]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The SWG NGE (or, if you&#039;d prefer, how about the SOE SWG NGE?) was indeed a rather noteworthy moment. It redefined the ways in which a gaming company can shaft it&#039;s playerbase and drastically change a game without any consultation with it&#039;s players.

I&#039;d be fairly surprised if we ever saw another game &quot;patch&quot; which changes the available classes of a game from 32  down to 9. As a player who sank way to much time into my characters, I&#039;m just glad that I managed to quit after the CU so I could join in with those who found the whole NGE implementation so utterly hilarious :)

(But hey, at least it was all pretty &quot;iconic&quot; right?)

Laughing at SOE&#039;s online exchange definately deserves it&#039;s #1 spot (think of all those fully templated Jedi accounts which sold for around USD$600-1000 on eBay), and Guild Wars also deserves it&#039;s spot for trying - it did quite a few things very well, it&#039;s just a shame about the rest.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My favorite moment in gaming for 2005 was the NGE, not because it was good or bad or I personally love it, but rather simply because of the impact it had on the genre. With so much media talking about how poorly it was implemented by SOE, I HAVE to believe by this point they&#039;re seriously questioning how they do things.

It also showed that a company is willing to completely redesign their game if they think it&#039;ll suit more players.

What the NGE is as important as how it was implemented.

Otherwise, I agree with all of your&#039;s :)]]></description>
