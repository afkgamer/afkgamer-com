					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m contributing to the war effort, but not from any kind of commitment or sense of duty, simply for the pure profitability of it.

Fish, farm, mine do what you want, cash it in for greens, DE and auction, come out on top.  Simple easy and hopefully still viable for a few more days before the economy adjusts accordingly and it&#039;s no longer worth the effort.

I expect the rush to hand in anything and everything to slow down over the next week or so when its no longer working in people&#039;s favor, but until then im stocking up on enchanting mats and aiming to land a cross-faction mount with a minimum of effort.
