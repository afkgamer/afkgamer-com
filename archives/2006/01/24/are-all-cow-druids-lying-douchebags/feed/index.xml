					<description><![CDATA[The truth of the matter is I won all the mats needed for the opening.

Two towns over.

In a  truth telling contest.

Also, this is pretty good Hornwood, but this isn&#039;t classic Hornwood.  If you ever need some material you should definitely do a full piece on him.  Just post on Medivh forums and ask for Hornwood stories.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hate to break form, but not knowing Hornwood all I can say is that it&#039;s pretty funny to imply that Medivh bought all the supplies - they&#039;re not exactly sold by NPC vendors, so somebody had to farm them.  I can&#039;t believe everyone who gathered 3 million linen happens to be employed by ubuygoldnowplzkiki.com but if they were and are now that much richer from the PvE uberguilds, uh, so?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a Medivh resident since WoW launched, I can indeed confirm that Hornwood is a lying douchebag. He of the famous &quot;my kids got threatened irlz&quot; lies, and the complete fabrication of physical threats from one of the community&#039;s most respected members (and subsequent deletion of those claims). Yes, Hornwood has something of a reputation for lying and douche-related containment.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Only been 2 afaik, Foton and Raster, and he only posted twice iirc.  

However, I think the lines you quoted didn&#039;t really imply they were from afkgamer, and even if so, you fed them the line, no surprise they used it to wind you up :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hornwood just learned a couple of valuable lessons about the internet, kids.  

Just to head off any future trouble, if someone sends you a tell in game claiming to be me or to roll with me, they&#039;re lying.  If someone touches you at night and says they&#039;re Foton or that they&#039;re touching you at Foton&#039;s behest, they&#039;re lying.  Plus you&#039;d need some heavy duty therapy.

Class dismissed.]]></description>
