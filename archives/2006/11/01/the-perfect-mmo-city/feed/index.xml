					<description><![CDATA[I am an alt maker, i have found that of the horde cities UC is by far the best - once you figure it out. It can be frustrating, to no end, but if you look at UC and IF, hmmmm separated a birth?  TB is like olde Kelethin, careful of the mistep, it&#039;s a doozy, and like KElethin, a pain.  As for Stormwind, one tip, swim. Look at the map of SW, notice where you want to go and dive into the canal, most places are easily reachable in this fashion. Darnassus, ahhh the jewel of the night elf realm, nicely done with professions and crafts somewhat together, but trying to find a class trainer, blech!  Orgrimmar is prolly the the worst as if you port in and want to head to BG&#039;s, better hope yer horse isn&#039;t tired.

PB &#038; J Time!!

					<description><![CDATA[Now that you can ride around UC mounted it&#039;s definitely my favorite horde city.  The circular design means that it&#039;s always a very fast trip to anywhere you need to go.  Orgrimmar is too spread out and almost seems like it&#039;s confusing on purpose.  

However, considering that the guards from any city will tell you where almost anything is, and gaming sites can fill in the rest of the blanks finding your way around any of the cities is pretty easy. 

My one problem with Thunder Bluff has always been that you are foced to dismount when travelling between sections, which is just an unecessary hassle.  If this is still the case that&#039;s reason enough for me not to go back there.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with Vargen - Orgrimmar&#039;s layout flat-out sucks compared to TBs, especially if you&#039;re a blacksmith or engineer.  Ironforge&#039;s layout isn&#039;t bad.  Stormwind == Orgrimmar.  I don&#039;t know Undercity well enough to have an opinion.  That &#039;trainers and vendors all in one place&#039; idea isn&#039;t bad, although it doesn&#039;t seem to work all that well for Darnassus in practice.]]></description>
