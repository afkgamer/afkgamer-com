					<description><![CDATA[Yes true.  I was focusing on the &quot;lengthening the curve&quot; and the bonus for dungeon (I read that as &quot;group&quot;) experience and the penalty for outdoor grind mobs (I read that as &quot;solo&quot;).  Hey, I see nerfs everywhere man, even in ATM fees.

I camped those very same Sarnak Legionnaires for that very same bracer.  I hope your EQ name wasn&#039;t Tiger-something.  That guy tried to jump my camp quite a few times and we got into a bit of a train war twice or thrice.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What are you talking about? All EQ ever was was a huge pve grind. You were lucky if you even had a quest to do. Most of the time, it was log in, lfg for a group or find out what your guild was raiding and then go do it. If no raid, then you grinded the same spot over and over hoping that the rare mob would spawn so you could get his phat lewtz and if you were grinding for a specific piece of loot, that that rare mob would drop it.

I counted one time on my Vah Shir Warrior the number of Sarnak Legionnaires I had to kill just to get one of them to drop the rare bracer with See Invis clickable ability on it. It was easily over 300 and all I was doing was killing the same 5 or 6 mobs over and over again in the same little building. And the 300 only counts the Legionnaires, not the hundreds of other trash mobs that spawned in their place or in the fortress that had to be killed to get to the Legionnaires spawn points.

The saddest part is that my warrior was level 55ish when I was doing this and the legos were all around 30 or so and I would still have times when I would have to run for zone or rest for a half hour to regen hp while wearing my regen breastplate.

So,I said all that to say, it&#039;s the opposite of EQ. Levelling in EQ was pure grind. In WoW, they want you to do quests and instances. Mix it up a bit and its going to be fun the first time through.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As much as I like grinding greens for experience one of my favorite things about leveling in WoW has always been the questing system and how it moves you through the zones and instances on your way to 60.

Any leveling guide that your read always focuses on grinding green mobs, however I find it much more rewarding to quest, and to spend a few levels in an instance banging out the quests in there.  You get better loot doing that stuff anyways.

Coupled with the fact that the instances in TBC are reportedly shorter, some taking as little as 45 minutes per wing, and I don&#039;t really see a problem with this.  I can&#039;t wait to check out Hellfire Citadel.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[ZOMG! I agree, it&#039;s EQ all over again... Say it ain&#039;t so? /cry

Oh well, probably the one thing that I miss in WoW from the game I came directly from (DAoC) is earning exp during PvP. You could lvl in DAoC just doing PvP, or you could turn it off to keep from dinging. Oh well, I hope Blizz puts that in sometime. Would make it more appealing to me to PvP more.]]></description>
