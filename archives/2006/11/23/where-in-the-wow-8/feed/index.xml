					<description><![CDATA[Haha!  I&#039;ve learned to keep my mouth shut at work for the very same reason.  I got tired of being volunteered to fix stuff.  I also learned to stop suggesting proactive projects, cuz I got saddled with those too.

Glad that you got it going and you&#039;re more than capable.  Are you going to remain the Admin for the guild site?  That could get taxing.  And from a purely selfish point of view, I hate it when my favorite bloggers disappear, so don&#039;t get sucked into that vortex.  My life is hell.  I need the laughs, so I need you more than they do. *evil grin*]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Doesn&#039;t this week still count as Thanksgiving vacation?  I&#039;m pretty sure it does.  I know that no work is being done around my office ... and won&#039;t be until about mid-January.

The other thing is, I FOOLISHLY bitched about my guild&#039;s web presence.  That we got any recruits at all with that steaming pile of crap is a testament to our loot farming dedication and (somewhat) stellar server reputation.  (no thanks to me, btw)

You know how it goes: you bitch about something, you&#039;ve just volunteered.  Dozens of hours later, our web stuff is done and operational.  

Best part of all was one of the officers asking if I had any experience with websites and posting news items.  There&#039;s a few titters in the background from the cool kids in the know ... me, after taking a comedic pause, &quot;a little.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Seeing as all my guilds have fallen apart... and I&#039;ve just rerolled realms again... it&#039;s a good feeling to know that somewhere in the WoW there is DKP waiting!

I was thinking about transfering my paladin (Gemma!) but this new realm is too...new.

DKP could be a good incentive...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[DKP bonus to Gemma for citing the correct name of the inn.  So Gemma, if you&#039;re ever in my guild in this game or any future one, I&#039;ll see that you receive that DKP bonus.  Equivalent points to one piece of gear, your choice.  

I&#039;m not going to gip you by saying oh, that bonus was only for bracers or a belt.  Could be chest piece, legs or weapon, any of the good armor pieces, entirely up to you.]]></description>
