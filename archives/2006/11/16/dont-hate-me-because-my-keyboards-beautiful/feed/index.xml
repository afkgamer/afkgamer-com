					<description><![CDATA[Would you like that alphabetically?  Cuz we could start off with Asshole, swing right into Bastard, CS, Dick and oft-Douchebag, E G O T I S T I C A L, but let&#039;s just stop before the &quot;F&quot; listings, because who would have time for all of those?  I sure wouldn&#039;t.

					<description><![CDATA[I work at a game development house. We got several of these for review about a year ago. Logitech wanted us to write plugins for our game to display on their keyboard, and was willing to give is &quot;marketing dollars&quot; to do it.

Then, just recently, they pulled the plug on the support program. My guess is that all the publishers and developers realized that it wasn&#039;t worth their time to write plugins for the .01% of the people that had the keyboard.

My guess is it will be discontinues within 6 months.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had the G-15 keyboard for quite sometime myself. I really like it - at some point in time WoW actually started making use of it (in that certain stats display on the LCD), but you already know the stuff on the screen, or don&#039;t really care about it.

The BIG downside to this keyboard is...the buffer (I think). Whatever the technical word for...if you press shift-up arrow and press space it won&#039;t work...is.

I think that&#039;s the combination, I&#039;m certain shift up arrow, right arrow and ctrl don&#039;t work either.

Essentially, when you start pressing a certain amount of keys, it doesn&#039;t get the last key. Very annoying (shift-up space is running jump for me).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, i was also looking at that keyboard, but instead treated myself to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.razerzone.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&#038;cPath=2_21&#038;products_id=40&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;razor tarantula &lt;/a&gt;.
