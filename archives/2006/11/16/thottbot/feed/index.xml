					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wowhead.com&quot;/ rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wowhead&lt;/a&gt; lately instead of Thottbot.  I like the interface more.  The only downside is that it&#039;s still newish, so the comments haven&#039;t built up to the same level as Thottbot&#039;s, so occasionally I need to swing back by the ol&#039; Thott to see if anything useful has been said about an item I want.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thottbot has always had its problems with reliable stats, but I don&#039;t understand the IGE shots.  There&#039;s blood on its metaphorical hands?
