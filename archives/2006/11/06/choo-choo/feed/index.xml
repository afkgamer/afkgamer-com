					<description><![CDATA[There used to be a bard Fansy, on a PVP server, that caused the developer to rewrite the code for the game. Up to level 5 you were untouchable for pvp, Fansy loved to goto Oasis of Marr, and with Selo&#039;s(run speed) and area effect damage, he would piss off every orc, sand giant, and specter, not to mention some crocodiles and a bonus ghoul.... 

/shout FANSY TRAIN TO DOCK/NRO!!


I played on Veeshan and leveled to 65 as a warrior and as a beastlord when Luclin made those available, the trains of Seb were always spectacular,

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, I played a monk too.    I&#039;ve logged out feigned way too many times.

The best trains were made by bards.

Anyone remember Plane of Hate?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I always liked my level 4 cleric I had parked in Karnors. After a group had rudely pushed past your mob clears and taken the choice spawn, he made an appearence. A quick dose of &quot;Invisible to Undead&quot;, a nice trip deep into the castle, followed by a 20 second invulnerable scamper back to the entrance taught them a lesson or 2.

And all I remember of Unrest, other than those trains, was there it was always were I took my mid teens twinks to powerlevel with my druid.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Heh, Unrest was nuts.  The outside groups with their backs flat against the walls until someone spotted a house group jumping down from the porch, and then it was a mad race to get the hell out of there before you&#039;re flattened. 

/shout WHO THE HELL JUST DID THAT???]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Unrest was the mother of all EQ train locations for me in the first six months of the game...shoot, maybe even Crushbone Castle. I remember seeing orcs boiling out of the front door of the castle and dropping players left and right.

Unrest was worse, though, because if someone trained out the stuff from the basement, level 12 and 13 characters working the front of the zone would be absolutely devastated by the level 30 stuff coming out of the basement. 

Hah, and after Unrest were the Mistmoore trains...the fun never stopped in EQ :)

Thanks for the memories!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I only played EQ for about four months after its release, but I saw enough gnoll trains in the first dungeon (Blackburrow or something?) to know exactly what you&#039;re talking about.  It&#039;s a shame I didn&#039;t stick with that game, from the sound of it I missed out on something really special.  I used to pride myself on my ability to make it to the zone line from almost anywhere in the dungeon.  I know on the server I played on people would often warn others of an incoming train by yelling TRAIN!!!]]></description>
