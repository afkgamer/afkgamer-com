					<description><![CDATA[Knowingly? No, because I have a healthy respect of the banhammer and this would qualify in my book.  As you are reaping the rewards of the exploit, you shouldn&#039;t expect anything less than a ban.  If someone used an exploit in the razorgore fight to bypass the eggs (like DI razorgore) would you expect only the pali that cast DI to be considered guilty?  No.  Either the whole guild zones out and waits on the zone-reset timer (about 45 minutes) to get a fair run of the encounter or they are knowingly exploiting even if they didn&#039;t personally cast the DI that caused the encounter to reset without restoring the eggs.

Unknowingly - it&#039;s possible, but I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;m not in a guild with enough people stupid enough to do that.

For example - show up late to a raid - zone in - get a summon (granted this would only be plausable if you were around 3 hours late to a raid at best, anything less than that would be suspect.)

Heck even if the teleporter npc wasn&#039;t offering me a teleport, my first thought wouldn&#039;t be &quot;oh these guys exploited beyond twin emps.&quot;  It&#039;d be &quot;stupid bugged npc, I need a summon now since the trash in the hall to fankriss will have respawned, and even if it hadn&#039;t what kind of sucker would run that far instead of getting a lock to summon them.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ok - lets say a lock and two players in your guild apply the hack - then start summoning. Hell, they&#039;re bored of the trash. You don&#039;t mind clearing it - after all, every instance since MC has been the same. Would YOU click &#039;accept&#039;?

I can&#039;t believe all 40 players in that guild installed the hack. Which leads me to wonder - did all 40 get banned?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Movement on the client is pretty much a necesasry evil - good luck finding an MMO that doesn&#039;t do this.  Considering the problem and the type of exploit, this is the sort of thing we&#039;ll probably continue to see in mmorpgs for years to come.

The obvious fixes as options are:
1) Forced progression via hard limits, like Domo/Rag in MC (boss 1 needs to die before boss 2 spawns or alternately before the boss becomes interactive.)  Of course in AQ40 you probably couldn&#039;t even tie this to boss deaths as the trash after Twin Emps is annoying enough that I could see some guilds just using an exploit like this to merely bypass trash.
2) Bosses later in the instance have their loot tables tied to boss deaths earlier in the instance (sure you can kill C&#039;Thun - but you won&#039;t get anything if the other bosses are up.)

Alternately you can do what Blizzard appears to have done - detect an anomaly (I bet they flagged these peopel for investigation server side when they had a C&#039;Thun death without a Twin Emps death) then pull out the trusty ban hammer.]]></description>
