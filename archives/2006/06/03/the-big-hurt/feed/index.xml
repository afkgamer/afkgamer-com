					<description><![CDATA[The Big Hurt graduated from Auburn. War Eagle!

If Barry Bonds played the game, he would no doubt start his character at level 1. He would then use a macroing program to get him to level 30. At that point he would hire a leveling service to level his character to 60. He would then become a guild leader of a guild called &quot;Fuegos de Cielo&quot; and be one crazy asshat of a player. All the while claiming &quot;I am legit man. Oh, So legit!&quot; Everyone would wonder why he ran with a limp and his armor was always in need of repair. Crazy Foozle.
