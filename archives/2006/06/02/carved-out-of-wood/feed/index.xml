Thank you.

					<description><![CDATA[One main reason I left constatly raiding in Evercrack was the constant regear/refarm cycle we were in.  We&#039;d be constantly be trying to gear the newcomers to our level rather than forcing them to gear to us.  I always felt it was a bad decision, and after about a year (guild above us left for WoW, leaving us as top dog) of treading water, I had enough and left.  A pick up raid group is leading the server now, with raid loot decided by /random so they don&#039;t have to do DKP management.  Former raid guild is treading water still.  
 
It&#039;s the job of that strong leader to know when to tell apps/raiding friends/etc to get up to our level rather than raiding 3 year old and getting tons of roting loot.  
 
Another thing that went away was that leader who didn&#039;t give up.  I remember raiding 5 nights a week, 20 days total, some PoP god for progression.  We failed on it every time, with usually 2-3 attempts per night.  When I left EQ, a single failure of anything would end the night, no matter how trivial.  You can end-game raid when you only allow 90 minutes for content...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;One of the pitfalls in running an endgame guild is redoing old content for newer members.&lt;/em&gt;

My guild solved this dilemma by hosting PUG MC runs.  Our mains who need Rag loot or some rare Domo drop fill out enough slots in the raid to make it viable, then we invite guild alts, potential recruits, friends, friends-of-friends and random weirdos from LFG.  

It&#039;s refreshing to the old hands who go to hear the enthusiasm from the new folks, and (with the exception of Rag) they get a shot at DKP-free loot.  PUGs and alts pick up the loot we don&#039;t want on the mains, so there&#039;s rarely a sharded item.  The random weirdos provide the comic relief.  People who wouldn&#039;t have access to the content get to see it, mains get their tier two pants off Rag, and everyone&#039;s happy.

Maybe something like that would work for you.]]></description>
