					<description><![CDATA[This rule that Blizzard has basically tells the casual gamer that we don&#039;t want you to have an account for too long....
The typical casual gamer;
1. play time is limited to a couple hours here and there
2. small guild or NO guild
   A.  limited gear/gold keeps them out of the big/capable guilds for epic items
   B.  most guilds have a resist gear requirement (no chance)
   C.  catch 22, can&#039;t get gear so can&#039;t get in guild to get gear
3. they may get a group but often have to solo due to limited time for raids and such
   A.  No named Mobs, no good gear....unless world drop

Some people can spend their time &quot;working&quot; in-game to make game money, some people can&#039;t invest the time in-game, so they use the invested time (work, J.O.B.) off-game to help them in-game.  The allure of the game, for me, is to get the strongest character possible.  If I get to a point where I can&#039;t advance my character without investing more time than I have...time to hang up the WoW hat!  A stale character is boring!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[People who tell gamers to get a life go out on Fridays and Saturdays until 1, and sit a a table in a bright bar talking to no one but the friends who came with them. Now and then they get lunch with someone they work with. Big man with an active social life and a hookup now &#038; then; the girls are all swooning.

And they don&#039;t read for enjoyment, or they&#039;d know it&#039;s pretty much the same thing.]]></description>
