		<p>Warcraft Patch 1.11 (.0, pending hotfixes) official notes and my detailed analysis after the jump, because this patch is freakishly large.  Hard to believe it&#8217;s all free.</p>
<p><span id="more-1155"></span><strong>World of Warcraft Client Patch 1.11.0</strong></p>
<p>Shadow of the Necropolis</p>
<p>Floating above the Plaguelands, the necropolis known as Naxxramas serves as the seat of one of the Lich King&#8217;s most powerful officers, the dreaded lich Kel&#8217;Thuzad. Horrors of the past and new terrors yet to be unleashed are gathering inside the necropolis as the Lich King&#8217;s servants prepare their assault. The Scourge marches again&#8230;</p>
<p>Naxxramas is the new 40-man raid dungeon that will present even the most experienced and powerful players with an epic challenge. </p>
<p>General</p>
<p>    * The cost to unlearn talents will now decay over time. This cost will be reduced by a rate of 5 gold per month to a minimum of 10 gold.<br />
    * Logging back in after a disconnect from the server has been greatly improved, and players should now rarely receive the message &#8220;A character with that name already exists.&#8221;<br />
    * Temporary item buffs (e.g. poisons, sharpening stones and shaman weapon buffs) will persist through zoning or logging out.<br />
    * Fear: The calculations to determine if Fear effects should break due to receiving damage have been changed. The old calculation used the base damage of the ability. The new calculation uses the final amount of damage dealt, after all modifiers. In addition, the chance for a damage over time spell to break Fear is now significantly lower. Note that Fear continues to be roughly three times as likely to break on player targets as on non-player targets. In addition, Intimidating Shout now follows that player versus non-player distinction, while previously it did not.<br />
    * Periodic Healing: Spells which do periodic healing will now have their strength determined at the moment they are cast. Changing the amount of bonus healing you have during the duration of the periodic spell will have no impact on how much it heals for.<br />
    * Reflection: Effects which cause reflection will no longer reflect triggered effects separately from their base effects (e.g. Impact, Improved Shadow Bolt, Aftermath, etc.)<br />
    * Spell and Item Auras with Charges: These auras will now correctly remember their number of charges when you enter or leave an instance, change continents, or log out.<br />
    * All controlled units will now be titled based on the creature type. All beasts will be referred to as Pets, for example (no matter how they are controlled). Previously, there were several inconsistencies.<br />
    * Beneficial spells and abilities that target multiple units will no longer consume resources (i.e. mana, rage etc&#8230;) if they fail to affect anyone.<br />
    * Chain targeted spells and abilities (e.g. Multi-shot, Cleave, Chain Lightning) will no longer land if target cannot be seen by the caster due to stealth or invisibility.<br />
    * Character model transparency has been modified to fix an issue where PC&#8217;s would appear to have a large hole in their model (be on the lookout!).<br />
    * Optimization code known as &#8220;M2Faster&#8221; is now enabled by default. M2Faster can improve performance in crowded scenes when &#8220;Vertex Animation Shaders&#8221; is turned on. This function can be turned off by setting M2Faster to &#8220;0&#8221; in the config.wtg.<br />
          o Reduces the unique number of vertex shader permutations that we will choose to use in rendering<br />
          o Sorts the drawing of items in the scene a little differently to reduce the number of times we re-program the vertex shader hardware. </p>
<p>PVP</p>
<p>    * In an effort to keep their armies better outfitted the Horde and Alliance have both taken it upon themselves to update their available rewards.<br />
          o An updated set of armor rewards have been added to vendors for Honor ranks 7, 8, and 10.<br />
          o The armor rewards for Honor ranks 12 and 13 have been increased in level and stat point allocation.<br />
          o New rank 14 weapons have been added! In order to give casters the same diversity of selection that melee currently enjoy we have added new caster items that are available to be purchased by Grand Marshals and High Warlords. </p>
<p>Battlegrounds</p>
<p>    * Alterac Valley<br />
          o Most of the NPC guard units have been removed.<br />
          o Players now drop more quest items.<br />
          o Creatures that remain in Alterac Valley have had their hit points reduced.<br />
          o The buff that is periodically cast by each faction&#8217;s Captain has been changed to a flat 20% hit point buff.<br />
          o Upgrading troops through armor scrap turn-ins will also now result in your team&#8217;s General enabling a periodic buff to your melee and spell damage.<br />
    * This buff scales from 10% at the Seasoned unit level, 20% at the Veteran unit level, and 30% at the Champion unit level.<br />
    * Warsong Gulch &#8211; Epic leggings have been added to the Warsong Outrider and Silverwing Sentinel supply officers for all armor types. These items require Exalted status with their respective reputations. </p>
<p>Druids</p>
<p>    * Innervate: This spell is now a base ability for all Druids, trainable at level 40. Any Druid who formerly had the Innervate talent now has the Swiftmend talent instead.<br />
    * Nature&#8217;s Grace: You will no longer consume this effect when casting a spell which was made instant by Nature&#8217;s Swiftness.<br />
    * Swiftmend: This new talent has been added to the Druid Restoration tree, replacing Innervate as the 31 point ultimate talent. It consumes a Rejuvenation or Regrowth aura to produce an instant heal.<br />
    * Enrage: Tooltip edited to clarify functionality. </p>
<p>Hunters</p>
<p>    * Counterattack (Survival Talent) &#8211; All ranks of this talent will now share the same cooldown.<br />
    * Scorpid Poison: Duration slightly lengthened.<br />
    * Changed the way hunter pet family armor bonuses and penalties are applied to allow the exact value from the Natural Armor talent to be applied correctly. This may result in a very slight loss of armor to some pets (less than a third of a percent).<br />
    * Improved Scorpid Sting: The aura from this Sting will now be removed (as intended) when a different Sting aura is placed on the victim. </p>
<p>Mages</p>
<p>    * Due to significant talent changes, mages will have all talent points refunded and can be respent. Training costs for all talent spell replacements have been significantly reduced.<br />
    * New ability added &#8211; Winter&#8217;s Chill.<br />
    * Arcane Explosion is now instant cast and will no longer remove the Presence of Mind effect when used.<br />
    * Evocation &#8211; Is now available to all mages (via trainer), starting at level 20.<br />
    * Conjure Food now has a new rank (Rank 7) available in Stratholme.<br />
    * Frost Ward now has a new rank (Rank 5) available as item loot in dungeons.<br />
    * Mana Shield &#8211; Damage taken will now be absorbed by other absorb spells (e.g. Ice Barrier, Power Word: Shield) before being absorbed by Mana Shield.<br />
    * Dampen Magic &#8211; Damage and healing reduction increased on ranks 3 through 5.<br />
    * Amplify Magic &#8211; Damage and healing bonus increased on ranks 2 through 4.<br />
    * Counterspell &#8211; Fixed a bug that made Counterspell unresistable.<br />
    * Improved Scorch &#8211; Duration of Fire Vulnerability increased to 30 seconds.<br />
    * Blast Wave: The bonus this spell receives from effects that increase spell damage has been increased.<br />
    * Cold Snap: This talent will now always clear the cooldown for Frost Ward, even if the cooldown was triggered by casting Fire Ward.<br />
    * Cone of Cold: The bonus this spell receives from effects that increase spell damage has been increased.<br />
    * Fire Ward: The amount of damage absorbed by this ward was increased substantially on all ranks.<br />
    * Frost Ward: The amount of damage absorbed by this ward was increased substantially on all ranks.<br />
    * Arcane Power: This ability will no longer stack with Power Infusion. If you gain both at the same time, Arcane Power will take precedence.<br />
    * Added a new level 60 quest available from Archmage Xylem in Azshara for mages.<br />
    * Fire Ruby now has a sell value and can be disenchanted. </p>
<p>Paladins</p>
<p>    * Benediction: This talent will no longer incorrectly provide a double discount to Seal of Justice.<br />
    * Blessing of Light: It is no longer possible for a target to appear to have multiple ranks of Blessing of Light. These multiple auras had no beneficial effect, merely causing confusion. Problems with targeting the spell when the caster has Blessing of Light effect on them have also been fixed.<br />
    * Divine Favor: It is no longer possible to cast this immediately after a healing spell and &#8220;retroactively&#8221; make it a critical hit.<br />
    * Illumination: When several critical effect healing spells are cast very quickly, you will now receive the correct mana refund for each one.<br />
    * Judgement of Command: Now consumes a charge of the Zandalarian Hero Charm. In addition, when this spell is resisted it will no longer erroneously still do damage.<br />
    * Judgement of Righteousness: Now consumes a charge of the Zandalarian Hero Charm.<br />
    * Seal of Command: Clarified tooltip.<br />
    * Vengeance: Seal of Command critical hits can now trigger this ability.<br />
    * Vindication: This effect will no longer be absorbed by Grounding Totem. </p>
<p>Priests</p>
<p>    * Lightwell &#8211; Casting time reduced. Lightwell object increased in size to make it easier to click; relative click radius decreased slightly.<br />
    * Mind Control: If you cast Power Word: Shield while Mind Controlling a target, the Recently Shielded aura will now appear on the correct target instead of yourself.<br />
    * Spirit of Redemption: This spell has a number of fixes: Spirit of Redemption form now has casting animations. Priests prematurely leaving battlegrounds with this aura on will now receive the Deserter debuff (as intended); Priests in Spirit of Redemption form at the completion of a battleground will have the aura removed without dying; It will now work correctly with the Darkmoon Card Twisting Nether item, resurrecting you after Spirit of Redemption has run its course; If you should die underwater the Spirit of Redemption will no longer have a breath bar appear; the Warlock Drain Soul spell will terminate producing 1 shard when the Priest switches to Spirit of Redemption form; You will no longer have to wait 30 seconds for graveyard resurrection upon your first death while using Spirit of Redemption.<br />
    * Vampiric Embrace: This ability will no longer heal for damage caused when the target had no life remaining.<br />
    * Shadowguard: This Troll Priest racial spell now works with Vampiric Embrace, Blackout, and Shadow Weaving. In addition, the damage from Shadowguard will now consume charges of the Zandalarian Hero Charm&#8217;s Unstable Power aura. The range on Shadowguard has been extended to hit anyone within vision range. </p>
<p>Rogues</p>
<p>    * Detect Traps is now a passive skill.<br />
    * Pick Pocket: This ability will no longer trigger effects on your target.<br />
    * Slice and Dice: This ability will no longer play its sound effect twice.<br />
    * Vanish: Canceling your Stealth aura while Vanish is running will now cause Vanish to be canceled as well.<br />
    * Hemorrhage: Your damage over time effects will no longer consume charges of Hemorrhage. </p>
<p>Warlocks</p>
<p>    * Shadow Ward now has a new rank (Rank 4) available as item loot in dungeons. The amount of damage absorbed by this ward was increased substantially on all ranks.<br />
    * Soul Link: If your pet is banished, Soul Link will stop functioning until Banish wears off. In addition, Soul Link&#8217;s tooltip has been clarified to indicate it only works with your imp, voidwalker, succubus, or felhunter.<br />
    * Curse of Agony: The damage from this spell will now continue even if the caster dies or leaves the area.<br />
    * Emberstorm: This talent will now correctly increase the damage the Warlock takes from Hellfire.<br />
    * Hellfire: Aftermath can now be triggered by this spell.<br />
    * Improved Shadow Bolt: Periodic damage spells and non-damaging spells will no longer consume charges of Shadow Vulnerability.<br />
    * Shadowburn: If you cast Drain Soul while this aura is on the victim, you will no longer receive two soul shards upon the victim&#8217;s death. </p>
<p>Shaman</p>
<p>    * Due to significant talent changes, Shaman will have all talent points refunded and can be respent. Training costs for all talent spell replacements have been significantly reduced.<br />
    * Anticipation: Now increases chance to dodge by 1-5%.<br />
    * Following durations have been increased &#8211; Disease Cleansing Totem, Fire Resistance Totem, Flametongue Totem, Frost Resistance Totem, Grace of Air Totem &#8211; Ranks 1 and 2 increased, Nature Resistance Totem, Poison Cleansing Totem, Stoneskin Totem, Strength of Earth Totem &#8211; Ranks 1 through 4 increased, Tremor Totem, Windfury Totem, Windwall Totem.<br />
    * The following mana costs have been reduced &#8211; Searing Totem, Mana Spring Totem, Healing Stream Totem, Rockbiter, Frostbrand, Flametongue and Windfury.<br />
    * Two-Handed Axes/Maces (Enhancement Talent) &#8211; Skill levels gained with these two weapons will now be retained if you decide to unspend this talent point and return to it later.<br />
    * Flame Shock &#8211; Damage over time portion of all ranks slightly increased. Mana cost of ranks 3 through 5 decreased.<br />
    * Improved Reincarnation (Restoration Talent) &#8211; Fixed a bug where rank 1 of this talent was not decreasing the cooldown properly.<br />
    * Elemental Fury: Tooltip now indicates it increases the critical damage for Searing Totem, Magma Totem, and Fire Nova Totem.<br />
    * Fire Nova Totem: This totem now receives increased healing from effects that increase the Shaman&#8217;s spell damage.<br />
    * Grounding Totem: This totem will no longer reflect the Mage talent Combustion back onto the Mage.<br />
    * Healing Stream Totem: This totem now receives increased healing from effects that increase the Shaman&#8217;s healing.<br />
    * Lightning Bolt: Mana cost reduced approximately 17%.<br />
    * Lightning Shield: Some battleground power-up effects were consuming charges of Lightning Shield. They no longer cause charges to be consumed. The range on Lightning Shield has been extended to hit anyone within vision range.<br />
    * Magma Totem: This totem now receives increased damage from effects that increase the Shaman&#8217;s spell damage.<br />
    * Searing Totem: This totem now receives increased damage from effects that increase the Shaman&#8217;s spell damage. </p>
<p>Warriors</p>
<p>    * Improved Bloodrage talent changed to generate additional rage when the ability is used.<br />
    * Improved Revenge ranks evened out, resulting in an additional 5% for the final rank. Chance to stun at each rank changed to 15/30/45%.<br />

    * Sweeping Strikes: This spell has a number of fixes: When used in conjunction with Execute and the second victim is below 20% health, they will be hit with the full Execute amount. If the second victim is not below 20% health, they will be hit with normal melee swing damage; If the ability you are using does not deal damage, it will not use a charge of Sweeping Strikes; The extra attack it generates when used with Whirlwind now has the correct damage range; The additional attacks generated by this ability will now properly take into account the armor of the second target. </p>

If you attempt to zone into the instance while that encounter is engaged, you will be resurrected at the outside entrance. We will be making adjustments to the entrances to Molten Core and Blackwing Lair to accommodate this change. Combat resurrections, soulstones, reincarnate, etc. will still work fine. This is primarily to combat graveyard rushing in instances.<br />
    * Zul&#8217;Gurub<br />
          o Class specific armor quests given by the Zandalarian trolls of Yojamba Isle no longer require Bijous or coins for completion. Armor quests now only require a Primal Hakkari piece and appropriate faction with Zandalar.<br />

    * Raid leaders now have a Ready Check button on their raid interface. This can also be sent with /readycheck from the chat line.

If this is selected all non raid instances will be reset for the party.<br />
    * Players now automatically have Keyrings. When a player first acquires a key, they will automatically acquire a keyring that can only hold permanent dungeon keys. The size of the keyring will increase as the player goes up in level up to 12 key slots at level 60.<br />
