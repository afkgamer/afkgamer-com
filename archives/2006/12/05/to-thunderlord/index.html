	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today is World of Warcraft patch day, 2.0.1 &#8212; one of those doom and gloom type patches too, with much wailing and gnashing of teeth.  Here&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/2.0.1">patch notes from WoWWiki</a>, pulled from pre-release information, so y&#8217;know, be wary.  Here&#8217;s some <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Patch_mirrors">patch mirrors</a> from same source, but considering the latest round of keyloggers going around the last week, y&#8217;know, be wary.</p>
<p>The big thing, of course, is the new talents for everyone, but there are also new limits on disenchanting based on item and skill level, which I suppose is the bandaid to deal with keylogging bastards (i.e. dismantling your stolen character will take alot longer now).</p>
<p>Never mind all that though, I&#8217;m more interested in the warrior community right now, which is heating up nicely because of the patch changes to threat and rage and tanking.  </p>
<p>Some of the warrior collective is so upset, in fact, that they&#8217;ve planned a <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=51895339&#038;sid=1&#038;pageNo=1">little protest march</a> on the Thunderlord realm on Wednesday, December 6, 2006 at 4:00 pm Eastern time (formation at 2:30 pm Eastern).  Planned activities include a naked gnome walk (or naked dwarf paladin walk if you&#8217;re supporting the equally alarmed shamans) from Ironforge to Stormwind.</p>
<p>Reply #23 by Blizzard party pooper, Drokthul, locks the thread:</p>
<blockquote><p>Anyone caught participating in this event or any event with the sole purpose of disrupting the game play for others will be punished.</p></blockquote>
<p>You know who else hates public protest?  Communists.  You&#8217;re not a communist are you, Drokthul?  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m.  totally.  kidding.  </p>
<p>Not that I would encourage people to be disruptive, but I think if you want to play on the Thunderlord server on Wednesday, you ought to go play on the Thunderlord server on Wednesday.  And if you want to have some &#8230; refreshments &#8230; while you&#8217;re playing on Thunderlord on Wednesday, I think you ought to have those refreshments while playing on Thunderlord on Wednesday.  And if your thing is interacting with other players in the public chat channels while knocking back refreshments on a Wednesday on Thunderlord, I think you ought to do exactly that.</p>
<p>And send me the screenshots, because I&#8217;m all about chaos and anarchy.</p>

Oh and by the way, the title &#8220;Million Gnome March&#8221; was for the LAST warrior protest in January 2005.  We&#8217;ll need a new catchy title for THIS protest.  Gnome Tea party was also taken for the LAST protest.

<p>UPDATE:  For-real patch notes from the updater after the jump.</p>
<p><span id="more-1271"></span>World of Warcraft Client Patch 2.0.1</p>
<p>The latest patch notes can always be found at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/implemented/  (Foton&#8217;s note:  &#8220;can always be&#8221; actually means &#8220;will eventually be&#8221;)</p>
<p>Looking for Group Interface Tool</p>
<p>A new Looking For Group tool designed to assist players in finding groups for instanced dungeons and quests will now be available. This interface gives players the option to be added to a pool of other players also looking for a group, as a means to expedite the process. In addition, players will also be able to search for additional members in situations where they have a group and are simply looking to find more players. For a complete overview of this new interface, please take a moment and read the information contained on our comprehensive Looking for Group preview.</p>
<p>http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/townhall/lookingforgroup.html</p>
<p>General</p>
<p>    * All players will have their talent points reimbursed and will have access to new talents throughout their trees; this includes the 41-point talents. Several new abilities have also been added for all classes.<br />
    * All pets will now receive a percentage of their master&#8217;s armor, spell damage, spell resistances, attack power, and stamina.<br />
    * Low-level spells cast by high-level players will receive smaller bonuses from +healing and +spell damage.<br />
    * HoTs, DoTs, and channeled spells have been re-balanced to receive a more appropriate (higher) percentage of +spell damage and +healing.<br />
    * HoTs from different sources will now stack (i.e. multiple druids can cast the Rejuvenation spell on 1 target).<br />
    * New item property &#8220;Resilience&#8221; has been introduced. Resilience reduces your chance to be the victim of a critical strike, and reduces the amount of damage critical strikes do to you.<br />
    * Weapon Skill now does the following:<br />
          o Weapon skill will no longer reduce the percentage damage lost due to glancing.<br />
          o The player will gain 0.1% to their critical strike rating per weapon skill against monsters above their level.<br />
    * When casting a buff on a low level target, the appropriate rank of the buff will automatically be applied.<br />
    * In PvP, Crowd Control effects will last no longer than 12 seconds instead of the full duration, with a chance of a heartbeat resist.<br />
    * Players will no longer lose faction when under the influence of &#8220;Mind Control&#8221; or the Gnomish Mind Control Cap.<br />
    * Several improvements have been made to the Macintosh client, including support for Multi-Threaded OpenGL on Intel Macs running OS X 10.4.8 or higher. </p>
<p>PvP</p>
<p>    * Honor System Revamp<br />
          o Current honor totals have been reset.<br />
          o Players may display their highest lifetime rank title (accessible from character sheet).<br />
          o Honor points earned each day may now be spent as a form of currency.<br />
          o Check the PvP tab of your character sheet to see your honor information.<br />
          o PvP rewards are no longer unique.<br />
    * Marks of Honor earned from battlegrounds are no longer turned in for reputation or honor. They are now used in addition to honor points in order to purchase rewards.<br />
    * Two New Arenas are now available in three different modes.<br />
          o 2v2, 3v3, and 5v5 matches<br />
          o Players may queue up at Goblin NPC&#8217;s in Stormwind, Ironforge,<br />
          o Orgrimmar, Undercity, and Gadgetzan </p>
<p>Druids</p>
<p>    * The talent &#8220;Swiftmend&#8221; will now include bonus healing from the talents &#8220;Improved Rejuvenation&#8221; and &#8220;Empowered Rejuvenation&#8221;.<br />
    * &#8220;Feline Swiftness&#8221; has been renamed &#8220;Feral Swiftness&#8221;. Dodge % increase now also applies to Bear and Dire Bear Forms.<br />
    * &#8220;Improved Moonfire&#8221; has been reduced to 2 ranks, for a 5/10% bonus.<br />
    * &#8220;Insect Swarm&#8221; has had damage on all ranks increased. Mana cost of ranks 1,3 increased. Mana cost of ranks 4,5,6 decreased.<br />
    * &#8220;Nurturing Instinct&#8221; now grants the benefit at all times, but the bonus has been reduced to 25/50% of Strength.<br />
    * &#8220;Omen of Clarity&#8217;s&#8221; duration has been increased to 30 min.<br />
    * &#8220;Improved Starfire&#8221; has been renamed to &#8220;Celestial Focus&#8221;. It now also increases the chance to resist pushback when casting Wrath by 25/50/70%.<br />
    * &#8220;Blood Frenzy&#8217;s&#8221; benefits have now merged with &#8220;Primal Fury&#8221;.<br />
    * &#8220;Improved Leader of the Pack&#8221; has been reduced to 2 ranks for 2/4% total health healed.<br />
    * &#8220;Pounce&#8221; no longer requires the druid to be behind the target.<br />
    * &#8220;Barkskin&#8221; is now usable while stunned. </p>
<p>Hunters</p>
<p>    * Traps can be set while in combat, but require a 2 second arming time.<br />
    * &#8220;Auto shot&#8221; will be automatically enabled if the Hunter steps out of melee range while in combat with target.<br />
    * 1 Agility will now grant 1 Ranged Attack Power.<br />
    * &#8220;Auto shot&#8221; is now reset when casting Aimed Shot.<br />
    * &#8220;The Beast Within&#8217;s&#8221; Bonus damage caused has been reduced to 10%, but now also reduces the mana cost of all spells by 20%.<br />
    * Freezing Traps will now cancel combat when cast. </p>
<p>Mages</p>
<p>    * &#8220;Frost Nova&#8221; (Water Elemental Spell) has now been renamed &#8220;Freeze&#8221;. </p>
<p>Shaman</p>
<p>    * Shaman with the appropriate talent spec are now able to dual-wield.<br />
          o Self-weapon buffs such as Windfury Weapon can be applied to both main and off-hand weapons.<br />
    * Rockbiter&#8217;s weapon functionality has been changed. It is now a damage proc instead of a flat attack power bonus.<br />
    * Windfury Weapon and Rockbiter Weapon enchantments will only benefit the weapon with the enchantment on it. </p>
<p>Warlocks</p>
<p>    * The range of &#8220;Drain Life&#8221; and &#8220;Drain Mana&#8221; spells have been increased. </p>
<p>Warriors</p>
<p>    * Rage generation from dealing damage has been normalized.<br />
          o All Rage awards are averaged with our expected rage per swing (adjusted for weapon speed). </p>
<p>Items</p>
<p>    * The &#8220;Far Sight&#8221; effect has changed so that the camera now zooms in to a distant location, rather than instantly showing the distant view. This also affects the items: Ultra-Spectropic Vision Goggles, the Ornate Spyglass, and the Hunter ability &#8220;Eagle Eye.&#8221;<br />
    * Spells can now require either a totem item or a totem category item to cast a spell. This means that the Enchanting Rods now count as all of the lower level enchanting rods as well, so you only need a single enchanting rod instead of all six. This also means that &#8220;Finkle&#8217;s Skinner&#8221; now counts as a Skinning Knife. Several weapons that are picks have been flagged as counting as a Mining pick as well.<br />
    * Items that give bonuses, such as critical strike percentage, have been modified to adhere to a combat rating system.<br />
    * All current items will provide the exact same benefit from ratings at level 60 as they provided before the ratings system.<br />
    * Thrown weapon items no longer stack, but use durability instead. One unit of durability is lost per throw, and these items can be repaired.<br />
    * The tool tip for the Great Staff of the Guardian now shows the proper increase of 28 to the party spell critical rating.<br />
    * Items that are useable from player inventory with a cooldown will now update the cooldown in real-time.<br />
    * Players will no longer be able to sell the &#8220;Blue Skeletal Horse&#8221; to vendors.<br />
    * The damage Proc from the item &#8220;Misplaced Servo Arm&#8221; will no longer break the Rogue ability &#8220;Gouge&#8221;.<br />
    * The &#8220;Skull of Impending Doom&#8221; has been changed and will now increase run speed by 60% for 10 seconds, but deals damage equal to 60% of your maximum health and drains 60% of your maximum mana for over 10 seconds.<br />
    * The Backfire effect on the &#8220;Net-O-Matic&#8221; will no longer break on damage. </p>
<p>Professions</p>
<p>    * All of the profession-made items that have been created up to now have been given proper stats based on the current expansion item level progression table.<br />
    * Most of the items made by Tailoring/Leatherworking/Blacksmithing have had their creation time reduced. Now the cap on time required to make an item in those professions is based on quality and level.<br />
          o New Max times required.<br />
                + Level 31+ Green Items at least 8 sec<br />
                + Level 31+ Blue Items at least 15 sec<br />
                + Level 31+ Purple Items at least 25 sec<br />
    * Skill level now determines what items you can disenchant.<br />
          o Skill 1= Level 1-20<br />
          o Skill 25= Level 20-25<br />

				<div class="comment-content"><p>It was the warrior whining over rage normalization that inspired this observation:</p>
<p>The optimist sees the glass of milk and says &#8216;It&#8217;s half-full&#8217;, the pessimist says &#8216;It&#8217;s half-empty.&#8217;  The WoW player says &#8220;Milk was nerfed.&#8221;</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p><i>&#8220;When casting a buff on a low level target, the appropriate rank of the buff will automatically be applied.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>How sad is it that this is the note I love the most? Class balance&#8211;eh, whatever, I have fun playing through it all. But the little annoyances drive me batty. Guess it also goes to show that I haven&#8217;t been playing as much lately.</p>
<p>Guess I&#8217;d better go see if I can find updated mods at all, or whether curse gaming is totally hosed. Thanks for posting these.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>The Blizzard Downloader is actually useful for one thing: Before it starts downloading, it checks to see if the patch files are already there, and then verifies that they haven&#8217;t been modified from the originals before resuming the download or starting to patch the game.</p>
<p>If you want to snag the patch from a mirror, just put the files in the World Of Warcraft folder in the exact same spot the downloader would put them, and then start the downloader. If the files were modified (infected), the downloader will only get what it needs to &#8216;fix&#8217; them. If the stuff you grabbed is legit, the downloader will just go ahead and patch the game.</p>
