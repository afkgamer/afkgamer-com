					<description><![CDATA[The Blizzard Downloader is actually useful for one thing: Before it starts downloading, it checks to see if the patch files are already there, and then verifies that they haven&#039;t been modified from the originals before resuming the download or starting to patch the game.

If you want to snag the patch from a mirror, just put the files in the World Of Warcraft folder in the exact same spot the downloader would put them, and then start the downloader. If the files were modified (infected), the downloader will only get what it needs to &#039;fix&#039; them. If the stuff you grabbed is legit, the downloader will just go ahead and patch the game.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I truly have trouble feeling sorry for warriors now that they are on equal footing with rogues. They&#039;ll have to use their leet skillz instead of their gear. oh snap did I say that?

I&#039;m happy pets get buffed. Maybe that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.plutospage.com/wow/archives/000382.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;stupid human boy&lt;/a&gt;
 they gave me for a minion will now be able to tank properly!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;&quot;When casting a buff on a low level target, the appropriate rank of the buff will automatically be applied.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

How sad is it that this is the note I love the most? Class balance--eh, whatever, I have fun playing through it all. But the little annoyances drive me batty. Guess it also goes to show that I haven&#039;t been playing as much lately.

Guess I&#039;d better go see if I can find updated mods at all, or whether curse gaming is totally hosed. Thanks for posting these.]]></description>

The optimist sees the glass of milk and says &#039;It&#039;s half-full&#039;, the pessimist says &#039;It&#039;s half-empty.&#039;  The WoW player says &quot;Milk was nerfed.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Drokthul needs to get laid, IMO. That guy is always such a jerk on the forums - even to people with legitimate issues.  I always wonder if guys like feel they must exercise their e-peen so stridently because they are losers in real life.
