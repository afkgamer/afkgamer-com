					<description><![CDATA[Saylah, if you click through the pics to Flickr, you can select All Sizes and view full-size screenshots.

Gesikah - same.  Think a lot of guilds are cutting back until expansion time -- we reduced our schedule from 4 raid nights a week to 3.  We&#039;ll probably reduce it even more during the holidays.  No one has the energy anymore.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Huhu&#039;s room...that whore. PS I hear Huhu has a big box.

Nanny-nanny! After the disaster that was our last AQ40 run (who knew 90% of all players were practically bots?), our raid decided to cut waaaaay back on our schedule and do more pvping etc to kill time until BC. It&#039;s probably a good thing I missed like the first three hours of it or I probably would have ended up /gquitting in a very dramatic fashion.

Also I think I might be playing too much...when I was putting my info in to post, I started to put in my login name and password. Hrmm.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Site changes look great.  Nice modern look and feel to it.  Only thing that gets me every time is that clicking on your images doesn&#039;t produce a larger version.  Unless there&#039;s something I&#039;m missing in Flicker?  Many of your images are of places I haven&#039;t been so it would be nice to see a larger image.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well that would explain the snickers from the better bloggers ...

And yes, that is Princess Huhuran of Ahn&#039;Qiraj.  You might think I ran down to a partially cleared AQ to get a screenshot of an empty lair, but really i just shouted at the stupid night elves in my guild to move out of the way.  Every guild screenshot there&#039;s at least 6 night elves who just HAVE to be in front of everyone.]]></description>
