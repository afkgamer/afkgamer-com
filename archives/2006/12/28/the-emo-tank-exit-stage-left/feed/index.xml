					<description><![CDATA[There is always an emo- type in every guild. Although I believe in people having their right to their feelings. The irrational display of those feelings has to be questioned. especially if those emotions get in the way of the groups advancement or function. 
I have been privy to some past guild drama issue by way of my class leader (I was an NCO of said class). The things that some of the emo players would complain about were unnecessary at times. Complaints about use of DMG meters, over heal meters, who is the designated water maker for runs! 
These people are game killers and suck the life out of the fun.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Aye, unless your guildies are all your best friends, you really don&#039;t have any business dumping all your emotional drama on them. That would be like doing the same to the folks at the coffee shop you like to hang out at, or people you work with. It&#039;s inappropriate, and it&#039;s reasonable for the rest of the guild to be uncomfortable with that if it keeps up and doesn&#039;t get any better.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[eh, normally i enjoy reading about the guild drama
this one failed
your overextending in trying to make yourself out to be some sort of a badass

the guy wants respect
granted, he is going about it the wrong way
chastising his actions is not helping him, nor is treating him like a child.

who are you trying to impress?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve read all of your emo posts and comments from others.  Is this really common?? I don&#039;t think this type of tank drama was taking place in our guild behind the curtains.  At first I just laughed at your recanting of the tales, but they go on and on. LOL  I wonder if our luck was due in part to the fact that 2 of the three main tanks were real life girl friends of officers, and the third was such a laid back guy and so loved by the guild in general, we just never had any issues.

Our drama was in the DPS casters.  Magewars and Lockwars abounded and were quite plentiful, then it leaked over into healer drama.  But we never had any never emo tanks.  We had an emo hunter but who really gives a ratzbutt. :-)  Oh, you not coming?  GTFO and be quick about it.]]></description>
