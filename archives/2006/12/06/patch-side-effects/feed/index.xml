					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not convinved you&#039;re missing all that much... I ended up levelling a lowbie as my main realm kept throwing me off after 30seconds, but i didnt find this out til 3minutes of lag later...

apparently everyone was in the bgs causing the lag, I didnt even get there hahaha! so far I LOVE the auto-loot (my little finger is saved!) and the self-buff feature - this makes such a difference when soloing healing classes.

So I&#039;ve had fun looting and buffing... simple pleasures!]]></description>
