					<description><![CDATA[like Heather, I have several Unamed on my ignore list - best one was the new guild i joined with and i had the Guild and Raid Leaders on ignore from barrens days...needless to say i did stay with this guild and found that soloing as a 60 warrior can be interesting when every  minutes someone asks me to join there guild or run them thru lowbie instance #4,982.

ahhh. The Death Announcements of DAoC, good times.....good times. thank you for making my day at work on Xmans Eve(i like my context better) a bit lighter and less dreary. 

oh! and the Myconid King and i had a special relationship, I had the worst luck in Seb that I zone in, kill left frog at zone-in and hark! what is that i hear? &quot;Tormentus, You will not evade me!&quot; ** poof** WHAM!  Yep i was dead no less than 8 times in one weekend of powergaming. ahh good times....as a added bonus my guild heard about this and would not let me into the group until after I had killed 3 frogs.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Heh, I remember all to well the death spam.

I remember getting an RvR raid together (50 or 60 Albs) and watching them all get pummeled by around 20+ Hibs, and probably some Mids that were in there somewhere. The death spam would be fantastic as Albs would continue to go and get their asses handed to them on silver, Celtic decorated, platters. Shrooms FTW! Ah yes, those were the days. ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree, love the zone messages, for PvP and PvE.

Kill spam was 50% of the reason to RvR in DAoC.  It also caused some assclowns to demonstrate that they were assclowns, but that&#039;s inevitable at worst and actually downright useful.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oooh, likin&#039; this style even more. Very &#039;clean&#039;.

Zone-wide death messages: AAAAAGH! STOP! BLIZZ MIGHT LISTEN TO YOU!

*ahem* calm now.

I find Barrens chat quite useful. (As well as the now-defunct LFG chat, which I guess has kind of moved to trade.) Since I have one of the infinite ignore list mods, I use it to find all the morons spamming Chuck Norris jokes that have already been spammed 200 times before, or endless Krol Blade jokes, and put &#039;em on ignore so I&#039;ll never have to deal with them. Very handy of them to identify themselves like that!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Keystone

I just can&#039;t bring myself to believe that Darkfall is ever going to come out.  I visit the site once a month to check for news and it&#039;s the same thing every time:

&quot;We&#039;re almost ready for beta, we just want the game to be finished before we let people play it&quot;

I mean, they&#039;ve been saying that for like three years now.

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with you that it is the little things that your remember.  For example, one of my most cherished moments in my MMO history was in Ultima Online when I would PK someone, then kill their horse, cut their horses corpse up into horse steaks, carve some kindling from a nearby tree, start a fire, cook their horse, then leave the cooked horse steaks on their body.

I would then hide nearby their body and listen for the eating sound after they came back ressed.  As soon as I heard the eating sound, I knew they just ate their own horse and probably didn&#039;t realize it.  It was at that point I would jump out of hiding and proclaim to the person they had just eating their horse.

Ahhh good times, I can&#039;t wait for Darkfall Online to come out!]]></description>
