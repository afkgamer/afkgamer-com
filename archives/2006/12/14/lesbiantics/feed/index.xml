					<description><![CDATA[Why are there so few in ANY fiction. Picking on  Blizzard is pretty silly they are not doing anything anyone else isn&#039;t. I have read tons of fantasy and sci fi, I can count on one hand the number of gay relationships. You might as well ask why aren&#039;t Jarlaxle and Entreri gay, or any other Forgottem Realms characters.

In fact, it probably isn&#039;t even some sort of conspiracy, people tend to write what they know. 

This sort of reminds me of the new Battlestar Galactica. They changed a lot of the characters to female to try to modernize it and show how sensitive they are, or something. But in the process they removed all the black characters. They went one step forward and 2 steps back. Eventually they had to make a minor black character into a major one halfway through season 2.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You can&#039;t blame Blizz for trying to stay away from it. It&#039;s a very politically charged subject, and they want to distance themselves from it as much as possible.

As much as I&#039;d love to see two lesbian NE elites going at it, it probably won&#039;t happen. Too many kids play WoW, and it&#039;d border on being soft porn at best. Besides, I don&#039;t think I&#039;d want to play a game where the male quest NPC hits on my male toon. Better yet, the man hating dike NPC who belittles all males needing the quest, and hits on all the chicks.

People come up with these bold ideas, but never really make suggestions on how to safely go about implementing them. Rather, they attack Blizz for not doing it. Shit happens and it&#039;s Blizz&#039;s game. They have a vision of the game and it&#039;s up to them to decide what goes into it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Considering they forced WoW&#039;s first &quot;gay&quot; guild to rename themselves and stop promoting themselves as being such, I&#039;d say there&#039;s a deep sense of homophobia in Blizzard.  The question is whether it is actual homophobia or just fear of where allowing such things could lead to.  

In a world where the most powerful nation (and many of the lesser but still more powerful nations on this planet) are lead by people who hide behind their religion to actively get around their homosexual discrimination (discrimination that should rightfully land them in court), the latter is all too likely.

Oh and by the way, I&#039;m not gay.  I simply oppose the blatant and obvious hypocricy I see in these cases.  I find it hard to believe they can get away with such things.]]></description>
