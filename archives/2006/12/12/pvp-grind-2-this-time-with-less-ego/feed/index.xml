					<description><![CDATA[I love swiftmend, but I get tired of having horrible DPS, which is the same reason I quit playing my Paladin.

Ah well, I&#039;ll just stick to my  mage and continue to melt  faces ^^]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I never heal anyone that asks me to. I also don&#039;t heal flagrunners in WSG if I see them exploit. I get yelled at for it but meh.

Though I do have macros /target Montana and such, for the better geared tanks in my battlegroup so that I can target them in the middle of the mob. I don&#039;t even know them, but I know I just have to follow them healing while their thunderfury clears a path right to Vann.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m semi-forgiving of the macro, just &#039;cause I had a friend who had that macro installed by a well-meaning mutual friend, and couldn&#039;t figure out for the longest time how to turn it off. What I really hate are the ones who stand there during a fight *manually* yelling &quot;HEAL!&quot; usually *while* my hands are all glowy (hello! casting time!). I&#039;m thinking, &#039;you do your job, I&#039;ll do mine; shut up and fight!&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just recently started PvPing period (Resto Druid, swiftmend is rigged btw). Other than one AV the week it came out and a WSG god knows how long ago, this weeks PvP is the only I have done outside of &quot;oh look, some dumbass forgot to turn off his flag before BWL&quot; occurrence.

I have to say...I thought it would be harder. Now granted I am running 100% in guild, but some of the teams we beat were pre-mades too. All weekend we lost one game. After all the qqing I had read on the forums, I expected to have my ass beat for me every time my hands went green. While, after awhile, someone would usually get around to killing me after everyone else was dead, only one team seemed to actively seek out the healers first. 

My favorite pvp memory so far: Me and one of of our holy priests defending Mills against an lolferaldrood. It may have taken us 30 secs to kill him, but it was still my first real kill! ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[UPDATE:  Today, I learned that doing the easy peasy pull of Vann is actually a GOOD thing, cuz 6 minute losses in AV &gt; 60 min turtle wins.

So my official stance on the &quot;Vann issue&quot; is:  omg, just kill Vann already, I need 3 more losses to get my pvp mount.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Heh, nice trick with trying to make the new folks think you&#039;re Shadow. And yeah, on those rare occasions when I take my priest into pvp I grab a warrior or mage or something and play healer.

By the way, nice rework of the site design.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Honor gains were just nerfed by 30%.  I can hear the crying from my cube at work.  Oh well, I knew it was too good to be true.  Too bad the people who probably cause bliz to take notice of this already have their HWL weapons and the only people being fucked over are once again, casual players.  

Is it really that big a deal to let the average player have some good gear for a couple of weeks before they get outpaced again in the expansion?]]></description>
