					<description><![CDATA[I like the people talking about how their uber l33t skills in the SW development world far surpass Blizzard&#039;s ability.  Because we all know how many client/server applications in the world have a user base of 6 million+ and service an average of 300,000 concurrent users.  And we all know that it is handled by a single super person that is infallible!

If your skills are so phat why the fuck are you here complaining about god damn LUA UI mods that you probably could patch up yourself in your god damn sleep?

Bugs happen in any development environment related to computers.  If you have the perfect answer then I suspect you are named Bill Gates or Steve Jobs.  If not you are missing the boat with your talents.

Blizzard is responsible for the bugs.  Blame them for it, but don&#039;t for a second sit around and act as though this is such an easy task to perform.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The &quot;automation&quot; mods can cause varies from class to class and person to person. I know for meas a hunter most of my UI mods do nothing more than tell me something that would have otherwise had ot have been called across vent and added unneccesary clutter over the channel.

@Nat

Nothing says you HAVE to use the mods. Even if a guild says they require it unless they are in your account they really won&#039;t know one way or the other, If it is &quot;too mechanical&quot; as you said remove the mods and voila&#039; you get to slap buttons however many times you want :P]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think the problem is that add-ons give players too much information on &#039;what is going on&#039;, information that players should not have fed to them. Sure these add-ons make the game easier to play but at what point does the game become too easy due to them. At what point can I basically &#039;check out&#039; and when the screen prompts me to do something I do it. I&#039;m not talking about my brain processing the input and making the call what I need to do, I&#039;m talking about the add-ons doing a huge portion of that processing and analysis for me. To me that is what is going on; it&#039;s like putting radar guidance systems in a football. With that we can all throw like a pro.

And about the wall hackers ... they could beat the bosses so what is the big deal. They just didn&#039;t want to deal with the pain of hours of trash mobs, right? To me that is bad game design.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For what it&#039;s worth, I think Blizzard DID make an effort to pander to the dev community.  WoWInterface gave out 900 beta keys to UI authors, then brought up a public test realm.  Plenty of opportunity to try stuff out.  Communication with the UI devs is excellent.  There were a bunch of changes made to the 2.0 UI based on mod author feedback.

If CTRA was broken at launch, that would either be because testing raid code is difficult on a test server (and the beta server has both Horde and Alliance UI dev guilds for such things), or because the CT people were too busy raiding to fix their code.

Not that Blizzard&#039;s QA is the best, but seriously, they DID make an effort for the UI community, and any AddOns that are broken now are broken because they were &quot;outside of the vision&quot; or because the authors didn&#039;t bother fixing them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Heartless, Nat ... are you two insane? The ho-hos who used the wallhack to do AQ like it was going out of style were complete idiots, that&#039;s a given.

I fail to see how a simple addon that &lt;em&gt;allows you to know what the hell is going on&lt;/em&gt; means they &#039;don&#039;t know how to play&#039;. It&#039;s like the man said in the post, status monitoring is not rocket science. I don&#039;t understand why the CTRA functionality isn&#039;t in the fricking basic UI!

Bah. I&#039;m glad I&#039;m out.]]></description>
