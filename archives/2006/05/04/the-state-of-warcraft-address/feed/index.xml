					<description><![CDATA[For a while now, I&#039;ve felt like im out of the loop whenever blog sites talk about WoW. I had to stop playing in beta in order to support my Lineage 2 clan, and never ended up going back. I&#039;ve had a strong urge to play it for at least 6 months or so to get a better feel for what kind of end game 6  million people are spending every day working towards... but...

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;You can do your part by discouraging your friends, relatives and neighbors from purchasing the game or the expansion.&quot;

I pretty much stopped playing at the end of December and my account expired in February. Now I&#039;m a happy lvl 48 Necro in EQ2. Will wonders never cease. When I left WoW I was certain I would buy the expansion (pre-order it even!) but Blizzard&#039;s continued inability to deal with their own growth has made that a lot less likely. How many people who have left the game will flock back at the launch of Burning Crusade? How much faith do you have to have to presume that this time Blizzard will have the hardware and software ready to support that onslaught of players?
I&#039;m also seriously wondering how they can possibly balance the lvl 60-70 content considering the vast difference in itemization between lvl 60 players. I dropped out with 6/8 tier 0 items, 1 epic and a pair of pants from DM. How could I compete with players decked out in tier 2 or 3 gear?
Now I find myself looking more towards other future MMOs. Warhammer, Conan, LOTR and who knows maybe someone will do something non-fantasy for a change that&#039;s worth playing.
Just be glad to know I&#039;m doing my part to help reduce your lag.]]></description>
