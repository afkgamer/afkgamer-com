					<description><![CDATA[HOLY-cow-crap-on-a-popsicle-stick!

This really isn&#039;t good news for players. 

Good for Blizzard because it equals more money. They also know that they have us by the apples because the game is so freaking addictive and fun to play. We just can&#039;t leave. I know. I&#039;ve tried.

Generalization? Yeah. Correct? Most definitely!

Please Blizzard, continue to kick me in the nuts some more.

Exactly how many people actually leave after threatening to do so. Very few.

Blizzard, you&#039;ve had server problems since day 1!!! I think we&#039;ve giving you quite enough time to fix that. I&#039;m sure it isn&#039;t as easy as waving your magic wand of Server Healing ( 342 INT), but I really hope that your customer service is stepped up and service is improved.

Gah, I&#039;m talking to myself.

Shame really.

Great post. Too bad I can&#039;t find a cup anywhere to protect the twins.

					<description><![CDATA[Consider what this will do for gold farmers, especially those who advertise in-game. This is carte blanche to create a million new accounts and spam to the high heavens, knowing full well that banning a trial account is an excercise in futility. As well, they can spread their sales/money transfers through tons of trial accounts and launder the money better than any mafioso could dream to accomplish.]]></description>
