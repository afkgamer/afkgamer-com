					<description><![CDATA[We sometimes get the odd belly-up dolphin in the river here in Brisbane, Australia.  Mostly though, we have a problem with gray nurse sharks in the estuary system -- they swam in when they were young enough to get past the shark nets, then grew up.  It&#039;s strongly recommended that you do not swim in any of Brisbane or the Gold Coast&#039;s waterways.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Goddammit.  I was hoping not to learn anything today.

I should apologize to the spammers trying to educate my ignorant ass, and I would, if only they used legit email addys.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Naw, some dolphins &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; live in rivers.

http://www.wcug.wwu.edu/~narf/dolp/riverd.shtml

Just not many (of the total species), plus they tend to be endangered.

I had so much spam sneaking through Akismet (due to overloading and timeouts) that I ended up turning on the much hated captcha.  When I&#039;m getting between 1000 and 2000 spam messages daily, and a 50 or more aren&#039;t reviewed by Akismet (leaving me to do it, horrors!), it&#039;s time to turn on the captcha again.

If I had the time, I&#039;d modify the code that updates the spam table in WordPress to also update a block list and kill the originating IPs at the firewall.]]></description>
