					<description><![CDATA[$500 for the gimped version. The one that has no HDMI (or whateverthehell that 1028p thing is called) output. So if you&#039;re buying it to watch Blu-Ray movies (which for at least a year more will be like UMD movies - you&#039;ll get to watch Punisher and the two Spidermans and that&#039;s it) you&#039;d better get the $600 one :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well the PS3 won&#039;t blow you, but it will play Blu-Ray high definition movies, and that&#039;s something no other piece of electronics you likely already have will do. Unfortunately, I agree with you, I don&#039;t want a friggin&#039; movie player, I want an upgraded game console, and I don&#039;t feel like subsidizing the blu-ray market with my gaming dollars. So.. well I may pass on the PS3, at least initially.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s some craziness on display in that interview, for damn sure- some good, some bad.  No new low level instances?  That strikes me as a mistake on their part- the best early quest lines were based around them, and eased players into the concept quite well. Although from the sound of it, they&#039;re going for an outdoor sort of instance, similar to in the Hinterlands, perhaps.

And the percent of players who&#039;ve killed Ragnaros and Nefarian has to be way off- all of the attempts at locking that down run to 25% who&#039;ve been &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; MC, to around 5% who actually participate in raid content with any sort of regularity.  The idea of being able to zerg MC does have its benefits, though (10-15 level 70s?  Sweet).  Course, doesn&#039;t extend to BWL, as I&#039;m reasonably certain Vael couldn&#039;t be done without at least 30 or so at any strength, not without major changes to the encounter, or a complete change to the power curve in the game.]]></description>
