					<description><![CDATA[This brings back memories. I still remember the first time I heard this in WAV format, many years ago. Then the only good thing I remember about Summoner was that it had this video on it. I still have that game sitting around just so I can watch the video and laugh sometimes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This video was included with the original Summoner game for PS2 and PC. The characters in it are all characters from the games Summoner, and Volition Software&#039;s other game, Red Faction. You could destroy walls and stuff, it was supposed to be one of the first titles with deformable terrain, but it didn&#039;t do all that well, it was kinda hokey. So, &#039;some graphics software company&#039; was the designer of the original Summoner and Red Faction, Volition.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow.  Where have I been?  I don&#039;t ever remember seeing or hearing this.  Although.  Maybe I did and years of alcohol near-abuse have killed those brain cells.

Great thing about blackouts:  everything is new and art is never derivative.]]></description>
