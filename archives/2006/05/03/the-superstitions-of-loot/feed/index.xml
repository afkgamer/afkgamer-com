					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been wanting to post a similar explanation on my guild website, using our data.

Randomness gives you annoying things like:
Nightslayer gloves are our most sharded item, by a large margin (not counting BS like nexustrike).
We sharded 3 Bloodfang boots in the last 2 weeks (bonus to one of those kills for also sharding a Venomous Totem).
3  months and counting with no Bloodfang hat, doing Onyxia every reset, sometimes 2x a week since we can field 80 some weeks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[All I know is the typical mage raid channels for the last month have looked like this:

IHateWarlocks
WarlockLootDE
WarlockSuck
OhMyGodMageLootPlease

Of course, we have 4-5 mages every run and only 1-2 warlocks... It just makes a Mage bitter when you realize that we are stockpiling Felheart BOEs in the bank now and have not received ANY Arcanist BOEs at all.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bring in one group of characters to start, of some particular makeup, boot (or exchange) various of particular classes, bring in others to finish the raid of different classes....

Enough said, yes?  That&#039;s why not make it representative of the makeup of the raid.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The real problem is that while the loot is (mostly) evenly random, the classes aren&#039;t. When there&#039;s 8 warriors, 8 priests, and 1 warlock in your raid, of course the warlock ends up with all the class gear they could want.

Given that instance loot is appearently generated when the instance is created, it wouldn&#039;t be that hard to make it match the class lineup a little better. They supposedly do this to some extent with paladin/shaman gear, so why not make the loot representive of the makeup of the raid?]]></description>
