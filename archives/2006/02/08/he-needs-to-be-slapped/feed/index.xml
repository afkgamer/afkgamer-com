					<description><![CDATA[Wow...just...wow.  My mom woulda been draggin&#039; my ass around the room by the ear while clarifying her expectations with regard to my behavior.  My dad, I don&#039;t even want to think about it.  Belt across the ass if I was lucky.  Who am I kidding?  I&#039;d have stuck my face in the fan before I&#039;d have talked to my dad like that at age 9.  Hell, he&#039;d probably kick my ass _today_ if I talked to him like that, assuming his heart held out.

All joking aside, that&#039;s one messed-up family.  God knows my little girl is pretty much running the house these days, but she damn sure ain&#039;t ordering my wife and I around like her personal slave.]]></description>
