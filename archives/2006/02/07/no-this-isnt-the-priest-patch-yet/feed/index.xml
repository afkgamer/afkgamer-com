					<description><![CDATA[Right now, I&#039;m having problems recalling all the things they&#039;ve done right.  O yes, holidays and special events.  Exceptional execution.

Ok, there&#039;s other things, but DAMN, the bad stuff is just wretched.  Last night, Dire Maul, my rogue is sheeped and I wander up the ramp, to the left, and start mingling with a dog pack and its owner.  Since dogs aren&#039;t fooled by stealth, vanishing was not an option and we did the quick trip to the graveyard.  We had a noob priest with us.  Ya, he should have dispelled.  OR, Blizzard could hotfix the sheep wandering as quickly as they did the weapon swapping.

Here&#039;s a good start:

&lt;strong&gt;World of Warcraft To Do List&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strike&gt;1.  Add chance to fail to rogue stealth&lt;/strike&gt;
&lt;strike&gt;2.  Remove loot tables from first few bosses in DM West.&lt;/strike&gt;
.
.
.
635.  Fix the out-of-combat delay after players are out-of-combat.
.
.
.
698.  Fix the wandering radius of polymorphed mobs and players.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For all the things that these guys have done right, I think it should be pretty obvious by now that they can&#039;t code their way out of an Intro to Java class.

This combat bug is especially devastating to warriors in PVP, since we have to be out of combat before we can charge.  No one likes burning a bloodrage   intercept just to close distance when a charge would have sufficed.  Aside from the obvious mistakes like the cloth disenchanting problems, my favorite recent little coding screw-up occured with 1.9.

If you recall, in 1.6 (I believe) a global cooldown was added when swapping weapons in combat,  1.5 seconds for every class but rogue (1 s for them).  Ok, one of the first of many warrior nerfs, boo hoo. I was upset since I&#039;d been swapping weapons for about 10 months at that point but got used to it after a couple of days.

When 1.9 went live about the first thing I noticed was that the global cooldown to swapping weapons was gone!  First thought was, &quot;Could they really be throwing us a bone here?&quot;  Of course not, it was undocumented and therefore a mistake which was remedied in the same hotfix that stopped the jerky character movement.

It&#039;s a little slip up like this that makes me wonder if they&#039;ve ever heard of version control before.  Maybe they&#039;re using second year CS majors for the majority of their coding.  Whoever&#039;s responsible, they make some fucking amatuer mistakes.]]></description>
