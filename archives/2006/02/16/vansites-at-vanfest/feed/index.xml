					<description><![CDATA[I played Vanguard at a friend&#039;s place (he&#039;s in the beta) and was surprised how dull and unfinished it was. No apparent quests yet and very liitle to do but bash random mobs loitering around the newbie town.

Another thing that was readily apparent but that I haven&#039;t seen anyone comment on is how amazingly much like DAoC it looks. I felt like I was roaming southern Midgard -- the same vacant open spaces with nice scenery but little else but scattered mobs. Yeah, the graphics are more modern, but it still felt empty and soulless like much of outdoor DAoC. 

Like you, however, I am still hoping it manages not to suck.]]></description>
