					<description><![CDATA[Queue&#039;s blow my flaccid epeen, their infrastructure is completely out of sync and I have no idea if Blizzard will be able to ever fix it. Every night is the equivalent to a patch day in another mmog, they&#039;ve gone to great lengths to try and prevent an influx of players flooding the higher populated servers and have over a hundred servers to deal with, it&#039;s pandemonium. Blizzard even stopped selling WoW over in Europe for a short period of time the stress on those servers were too much. I&#039;d rather put up with the shit than have zero access, but yea, it&#039;s frustrating. Suggest another game the offers the accessibility via increments that WoW offers and which isn&#039;t run by vile fuckwads who repeatedly azz rape their userbase.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think that put simply, if you are paying a monthly fee on top of the retail price of the game, the company that provides the game, should not force anyone to wait in line for access to a service that they pay monthly for.  I know some people may put this akin to paying for admission to an amusement park then still having to wait in line for a ride, but really it is quite different.  You are subscribed as a customer, they &lt;strong&gt;should &lt;/strong&gt; be able to estimate the load that their service can deliver and with that information expand the delivery method to accomodate those new subscribers to the service. 

I completly understand downtimes, and upgrades but if you pay a monthly fee and that service is not in repair, the subscriber should always have access to it without a wait.

Again this is just my opinion, and I don&#039;t think I would feel that way if the subscription model was something like Guildwars, etc where there was no monthly fee.  I am also not a huge wowhater or anything,  I do enjoy EQ2 far more, but if it were a role reversal and I loved WoW, I still would not stand for being queued to get into the game.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I find the game very enjoyable, so I tolerate the wait, but queues and performance are my two biggest problems with the game.  I also think that people have so much invested in their characters, and enjoy their online relationships so much, that they&#039;re willing to put up with quite a bit of inconvenience.

On a related note, has anyone else noticed that if you&#039;re booted from the game you&#039;re not necessarily forced to sit throught the queue again?  I don&#039;t know exactly when it started happening, but if I&#039;m booted for any reason, I can usually log back in withing ~5 minutes or so and not have to sit through queue.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[my pet theory is that nothing else on the market is comparable.

The other games are so much worse that even waiting in queue once in a while (only sunday afternoon on my server though) is preferreble to playing them.]]></description>

How did it come to this?  I have left better games over less.
