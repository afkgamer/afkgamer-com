					<description><![CDATA[Krones is on the money, for me at least.  Too busy grinding. I&#039;m trying to keep up with everyone in my main guild and I started a guild with people from my forums on the PvP server.  I&#039;m writing this while waiting for a teleportation spire to activate.

The launch had server problems the first day, which was understandable.  But problems on day two are not understandable.  I&#039;ll write a more detailed report this weekend.  This week&#039;s posts were pre-written.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think if you&#039;re really looking for some info on EQ2 would be to keep up-to-date on the high end raid guilds in the game. I know back in the EQ1 days FoH (http://www.fohguild.org)/ news page and forums always made for good reading. Of course now FoH is in WoW and Furor works for Blizzard. (funny how those things work out!) Find the top raid guild websites, and there&#039;s your goldmine right there.]]></description>
