					<description><![CDATA[Maybe you missed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gamedaily.com/specials/Video_Game_Couples/?rp=1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this article about great loves in gaming&lt;/a&gt; ... like Mr. and Mrs. Pac Man.  Warms the heart, doesn&#039;t it?  Ok, probably not.

Anyhow.  Guildmates with those stupid VD rewards are becoming quite the menace on raids.  At one point during Onyxia, we had 10 of those STUPID FAIRY GOBLINS flying around in the lair, which lead to a zero tolerance ban on stupid fairy goblins.  If someone sics one of those fairies on your ass, the only escape is zoning, or if buried deep in an instance, dying.

Which is exactly what I did at Onyxia -- kinda sorta on purpose, because I get credit whether I&#039;m dead or alive.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This was -- by far -- the most enjoyable VD post I&#039;ve encountered (even being a die-hard romantic).

After being the recipient of my 7th damned Love Fool on Destromath during the VD fun and frolic, it was a refreshing change of pace to read your engaging Anti-Valentine solution to the Obligatory Hallmark Holiday.

I also had no clue that Ragnaros had a MySpace account, which sent gales of laughter through everyone on ventrilo who had their butts burned on Sons of Flame.  Gratzie!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, if you go around licking like that, you likely to spread your VD to everyone much like the Blood God disease that went around WoW last year.  I&#039;m still certain that was spread through licking after visiting Zul&#039;Gurub althought the Blizzard coverup was that it was just a bug. :-P]]></description>
