					<description><![CDATA[What I hate about all this holiday crap is that it always ends up lagging the main cities into oblivion. I was in Darnassassass turning in a quest and I LAGGED! NO ONE WAS THERE AND I FRICKING LAGGED! And it&#039;s because of these idiotic holiday directions. Put that shit in Nijel&#039;s Point or something. Or someplace else that I will never ever go.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had fun with the rose petals applying them to unsuspecting noobs and random mobs.  Then I applied one stack to an elf hunter&#039;s spider.  He got pissed, especially when I told him that I didn&#039;t think they could be removed.  I&#039;ve been playing mmos since UO first came out and for the first time I got a glimmering of why griefers do what they do.  But otherwise it does kinda bite.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Only one good thing about the whole valentine&#039;s shenanigans: kiss the little cupid-goblin in any major city and get  200hp for an hour, no matter your level.  Alt-a-licious.

I did the whole lot of the quests, no reputation, nothing but some soulbound chocolates giving buffs useful to OTHER classes... PLUS I got rejected by an Abomination, and that&#039;s about as low as it can get. :~(

Stark contrast to the Lunar Festival coin hunt, which was an interesting and varied way to grind faction!  6.6k rep away from my great kodo, woot.]]></description>
