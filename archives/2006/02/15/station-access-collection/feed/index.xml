					<description><![CDATA[I concur.  That&#039;s way too many MMO&#039;s -- for me the only plus to having Station Access is getting the extra toon slots for EQII.  I don&#039;t want the other games, just the additional toon slots for my current game--and I&#039;m willing to pay a reasonable additional monthly fee to get it.  However,a friend thought by adding Station Players to my account I would get the 4 extra toons for $2.99 a month--wrong.  SOE doesn&#039;t make it easy to figure out how to cancel certain portions of one&#039;s subscription.  With that in mind, I&#039;m reluctant to try Station Access to get the extra toons for EQII (because I sure as heck don&#039;t want the other games; spending too much time in EQII as is).  It&#039;s not clear to me that the $24.99 a month for Station Access would include the account fee of $14.99 or if the cost is on TOP of the $14.99 (which would bring the total to almost $40 bucks a month!)

SOE...please...just give us the opportunity to buy extra toons for the games we DO play.  I&#039;m an adult gamer with a job and no time to get involved with all your creations.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That just seems like too much MMO for me.  I wouldn&#039;t be able to keep up with that many characters without it affecting me mentally.  I usually have a PS2 game, a PC game, and just one MMO at a time that I rotate around.  Having that many MMO characters in that many worlds would destroy me.  It&#039;s already bad enough that I dream about something happening in game.  Besides, on MMO sucks so much time, seems like five MMO would make Sony own every breath I take.]]></description>
