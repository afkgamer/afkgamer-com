					<description><![CDATA[You know what&#039;s funny? Upon Blizzard Europe&#039;s requests Vivendi stoped selling WoW to distributers untill they have the new cluster up and running. And Bulgaria&#039;s reps of VUG are all out. So if you want to get wow here, you have to buy an account from someone, or wait till april or something. I&#039;m guessing that&#039;s the situation in other low-priority territories as well :)

You just have to love them, now they won&#039;t even take people&#039;s money.]]></description>
