					<description><![CDATA[I agree that the Stargate setting is well-suited for an MMO. Probably a Guild Wars style game, with jumps through the Stargate leading to instanced worlds? That would, in theory, also make some of their goals possible, such as the apparent emphasis on actually changing the world and altering the subplots slightly. 

I&#039;m skeptical, because at the moment it&#039;s just another MMO, but if it did work out I think it&#039;d be pretty cool.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hated SG-1 at first because I was expecting it to be like the movie.  I blew it off for years until I borrowed the first season on DVD and was hooked.

The world would lend itself well to MMOs, since the show itself is already a hub and instance design.  The game could include themes from all cultures and periods of history from medieval to distant future while remaining entirely within the show&#039;s canon.

Of course good starting material is about 1% of what makes a good MMO.  That might be generous actually, it may not matter at all outside marketing.]]></description>
