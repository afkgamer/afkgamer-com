					<description><![CDATA[This is Blizzard, remember?  Look at Diablo, where the inventory was not only finite, but the items had dimensions as well (1x1 slot, 2x1, 3x2, etc).  And just to make the &#039;game&#039; of inventory arrangement even more fun, there was no &#039;Autoarrange&#039; option, so you had to move that shit around by hand to make it all fit best.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You speak truth.  I can&#039;t remember the last time my inventory was better than 70/80, and that&#039;s using an AH mule, enchanting mule, leatherworking mule, mules holding crap I&#039;ve forgotten about, and leaving about 20 items in my mail at all times.  When I&#039;m on my herbing rounds it&#039;s typically bag space that makes me quit (wtb mailbox in Un&#039;Goro) unless I&#039;ve taken it seriously and mailed all my raiding consumables to an alt.  

And I know some classes/professions have it worse.  I would kill myself if I were a Warlock.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you&#039;re a pack rat that has trouble throwing things away, managing inventory is stressful, not fun, stressful.  I think I&#039;ve been holding onto the same damn mechanical yeti since February of last year.  Those 10 rough grinding stones?  Just let them go buddy, you haven&#039;t made a pearl handled dagger in over a year.]]></description>
