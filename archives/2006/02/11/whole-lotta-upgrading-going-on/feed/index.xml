					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, Bloglines supports basically everything. When I unsubscribe from your blog and resubscribe, it presents me with a choice of 5 feeds:

https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/ [https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/feed/rss2/]
https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/ [https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/feed/atom/]
https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/ [https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/feed/]
https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/ [https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/feed/rss/]
https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/ [https://afkgamer.github.io/afkgamer-com/comments/feed/]

All of them show &#039;Whole Lotta Upgrading&#039; as the most recent entry. Even the Comments feed doesn&#039;t show those for the more recent blog posts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My guess is something with the upgrade to WordPress 2.0.1.  My feed validates RSS, but WP is still stuck on Atom .3 (deprecated version), although I see on the Bloglines FAQ that it supports RSS also.  *shrug*

Is that more than you wanted to know about feeds?  More than I wanted to know, that&#039;s for sure.  I&#039;ll check around and see if I can figure out what&#039;s the hap and thanks for the heads up.

EDIT:  Looks like it&#039;s working now with Bloglines, was a problem with the permalink structure which is a commonish problem with WP 2+  upgrades.  In case another WP user has a similar issue, I deleted my .htaccess, created a new empty one, had WP redo the file in Options/Permalinks, POOF, fixed.  

And that&#039;s probably more than you wanted to know about WordPress.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, sorry, I just wanted to point out that since you upgraded, I don&#039;t seem to be picking up your posts on Bloglines. Every time I check, it only shows posts up until this one (Whole Lotta Upgrading). It&#039;s not picking up anything after that. Any idea what would cause that?]]></description>
