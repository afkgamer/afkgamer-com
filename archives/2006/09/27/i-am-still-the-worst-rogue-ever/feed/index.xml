					<description><![CDATA[Dreaming, to be fair, you won&#039;t ever get any USEFUL gear out of it.  There&#039;s those spiffy mounts however.  Which are a different color.  But that isn&#039;t useful either, to be honest.

And look everybody, Raster came out from backstage to remind me &lt;strong&gt;again&lt;/strong&gt; that he has the full complement of PVP mounts and I do not.  Thanks Raster!  Appreciate it, douchebag.

@Puhase, we don&#039;t send in a scout to ck out the WSGs or the ABs, but I have seen Horde teams do that.  There&#039;s one Horde guy for the first few moments of the game, then he leaves and a fresh PUG or premade team pops in.  If we pull a premade WSG or AB, we just fight it out.  Not fast and furious honor that way, but usually a really good match.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was just wondering, if you have a premade team going...do you use the Pug Farming trick?
Basically, you have your leader que you into WSG but not enter with the rest of you team when the message comes up. The team checks to see if the entire other team is from one server(aka. a premade doomsquad). If so, the leader que&#039;s the team for AB and you scoot out when it pops 30-45 seconds later. Rinse and repeat until you find an appropriate PuG to squash. Usually takes 5 minutes at the most, which is far preferable than a 30 minutes AB or an hour long WSG turtlefest against another premade.
Now, before anyone flames, let me say one thing. This is strictly for those grinding out honor on a limited timetable. Those wanting just a good game of WSG with some guildies obviously shouldn&#039;t do this and I don&#039;t do this all of the time. But alot of us have limited time in between RL and raid schedules and you have to max your honor as best you can.
Anyways, for all those in Battlegroup 1, look out for my pvp alt mage!]]></description>
