					<description><![CDATA[As a recruitment officer I often wish I could make a master list on my realm forum stating why each applicant is denied. Alas that would only start flame wars. It would be nice to share this information though. 

Particulairly the people that apply saying &quot;Im not about loot&quot; then dont make it through the application process stating &quot;wtf why didnt i get that item&quot;.

Though kicking out the guy that turned out to be a huge racist and then seeing him in another fairly reputable guild kinda bothered me too.

I find myself too often saying &quot;Why cant people just NOT be jackasses.. comeon.. its no hard&quot;]]></description>
