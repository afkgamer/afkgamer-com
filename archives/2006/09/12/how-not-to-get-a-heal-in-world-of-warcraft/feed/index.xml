					<description><![CDATA[In Guild Wars it took exactly two quests for my priest to get an @$$hole comment. This was from the doofus who ruined our bonus mission by killing the guys we needed to follow and then leaving our group after tossing off comments at me and all the others... The other guys on the run invited me into their guild and made me an officer shortly thereafter, so I felt vindicated. ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My observation, the 3 primary reasons someone isn&#039;t getting healed in a battleground:

1.  He/she is not protecting the healer.
2.  He/she is being a bag of douche.  (No heals for you!  Come back, one year!)
or 3.  Shit has just happened.

There&#039;s also 4.  The healer in question is one of &quot;those&quot; paladins, you know the kind I mean.  Swinging their hammer around in the air instead of popping a few heals on the rogue-buzzsaw who&#039;s desperately trying to save his paladin ass.  

That 4th one is open for argument, however.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Had a warlock scream at me once (a druid) for casting moonfire on a rogue kicking his butt.  Apparently, he was trying to seduce the guy, and my moonfire broke it.  Nevermind that immediately after I popped the moonfire, I healed him like he had never been healed.

It was amazing.  And, he never got healed again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yep great tales! I&#039;m loving the guild tension ones the most. We have our own (&quot;zomg you buy gold from farmers?&quot;). It&#039;s a bit like finding out your mates have started snorting cocaine. What strange sub-currents you get in a fantasy world - certainly something most articles on the genre don&#039;t pick up on.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha, no, he never said he&#039;s you. I was just wondering.
Thanks for the reply, and keep the good job up! I&#039;m laughing my butt off each time I&#039;m here!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is that guy saying he&#039;s me, cuz he&#039;s a damn dirty liar.  I don&#039;t play under the name Foton in Warcraft, made up a minty fresh name for this game.

Unless you&#039;re looking for Foton to shoot, then ya, that guy&#039;s me, so shoot him.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha, I think I know that guy. At least he&#039;s bad-tempered, just like that guy, AND his name starts with Pure!

By the way, Foton. Which server are you on? Because I know a Foton that&#039;s a rogue and alliance, so I&#039;m just curious to see if it&#039;s you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Every time i see a hunter walking backwards i die a little on the inside.
When Im priesting it up and I dont give that hunter heals, they sometimes switch to naked mode for pulls assuming that they will die on every pull. Killing me softly..]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It doesn&#039;t take nearly that much for me to stop healing someone. Heals are a privilege, not a right.

Seems like all healers can be put in two catagories: those who feel duty-bound to heal everyone and those that feel duty-bound to teach people to lrn2play. I fall in the latter. Those of us in the latter have tried repeatedly to explain it to those in the former,but rarely do they accept our teachings. If you heal them, they will never learn better behavior. The mage will still not control their aggro, the warlock will still Hellfire, then Lifetap himself down to 10 hps in the suppression room and then not bandage, the hunter will still not learn that kiting does not involve stopping to turning around to see if the target is still following. If people had not coddled them all this time, then we wouldn&#039;t having this problem NOW. Healing nubs 1-59 just means you are gonna have more smacktards at 60 than we do now.]]></description>
