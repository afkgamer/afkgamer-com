					<description><![CDATA[Daztur almost all of what he wrote applies to levelling guilds and casual guilds as well. Even people in real life. You only are looking at one little example, you have to look at the whole package.

People who whine constantly about how poor they are, are obsessed with what loot they can get, act squirrely in an undefinable way, spread rumours, complain all the time. These are not people you want in your life, they are negative and draining.

Ironically it&#039;s the people that raid in order to farm for phat loot that end up unguildable. Most raiders mainly want to overcome new challenges, and there are varying levels of committment between hardcore and casual. For instance I am casual, but all those same ideas apply.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;strong&gt;Last night&#039;s storm...&lt;/strong&gt;

We had quite a storm last night. At some point there was a thunderclap so loud and close that I don&#039;t mind admitting it scared the hell out of me &#038; the cats. Later I think I found out just how close it was--there&#039;s a big ol&#039; tree in our neighbors&#039; ...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You really want me to blow your mind? Our guild alliance is made up of 4 guild: Us (probably 80% of the raid), the guild we will probably eventually absorb if we can get them away from their cult-like multi-game clan, a guild made up of one chick (don&#039;t ask, we don&#039;t), and a ...ready for it?....farmer guild. Ok so they are not all farmers (they are mostly all jacktards though), but the GL has admittedly accepted farmers (something about trying to teach them the error of their ways or some shit) and it&#039;s a large enough percentage that when you see someone with their tag you assume they are a farmer until evidence to the contrary. 

The funny part is that the farmer guild GL would get all butthurt when we were reluctant to allow any of his members to fill open raid spots. The hilarious part is not really because we were afraid of ninja&#039;ing (would give us an excuse to severe ties actually), but we have already had to demote most of his guild into oblivion because they fucking suck.

Daztur - Actually the politics of the endgame is quite a bit of fun (if you enjoy that kind of thing).  It&#039;s like a constantly ongoing game of Survivor only instead of the winner getting a million dollars they get Tier 4 chestpiece. ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[End game PVE is good fun because you get to assemble 40 people in a raid to achieve the proposed content. It is also a nightmare for the exact same reason (40 people? with the exact same idea of what &quot;successful guild&quot; means? no way).

By the way, Foton, thank you for the blog. Most of your posts about guild drama and raiding end up linked in my guilds&#039; officers forum (after some occasional translation into French)... I can tell you that when it comes to WoW cultural differences are but minimal. We even have our frog-eating Emo Tank.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, the more I read about the endgame of WoW the less fun it seems. Its never a good sign when part of the game gets described as &quot;work&quot; and what&#039;s up with booting people from a guild (let alone having them be unguildable) because they wanted to PvP?

Damn.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, sympathies, but gotta say, glad for once it&#039;s not my guild. It&#039;s a lot easier to take this all with an amused smile when it&#039;s someone else&#039;s headache, ya know? I let someone talk me into being a guild officer once, and NEVER again. Just hate the dramatics too much.

But I do remember getting that feeling a few times back when I was one, and while I wasn&#039;t always right when I thought someone was okay, I was always right when I thought they weren&#039;t. I think there was one exception, but even that was only sort-of an exception (a guy who had a good heart but could make an enemy of a saint... none of the officers had the heart to kick him because he really was a good guy, but he wasn&#039;t good for guild morale and tended to make a bad impression on new people). People are complicated. Which is annoying. :)]]></description>
