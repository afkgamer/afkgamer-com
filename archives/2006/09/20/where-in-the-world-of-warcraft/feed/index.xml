					<description><![CDATA[A larger picture would help for some of them. (Is that a tree...or an undead warlock?)

1. Kinda hard to tell, but I am thinking that burnt out inn in Dustwallow, like on your way to the Barrens.
2. Looks like the Wetlands, by the Bluegill murlocs?
3. Docks in Auberine?
4. Ragnaros&#039; Lair
5. Winterspring
6. Silithus
7. Hard to tell..but I will say the Wetlands again. By the graveyard?
8. Uther&#039;s tomb
9. Booty Bay
10. Thunder Bluff
11. Nefarian&#039;s lair, throne
12.  Magmadar?
13. Gnomeragan?
14. hrmm...Steamwheedle?
15. Northgate Outpost
16. Darkshore during the summer festival
17. Mage Quarter, Ironforge
18. Orphanage in Stormwind

Probably got alot of those wrong. Haha.]]></description>
