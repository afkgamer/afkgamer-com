					<description><![CDATA[I agree with Typhoon on this one. We could even vote people onto the server.

To make it more interesting, we could somehow be able to &#039;view&#039; this server once they&#039;re all on. Laugh at the dialog. Mock the raiding attempts. Somehow they could even integrate betting into it.

Televised WoW... the beginning to an end...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Agree with Pietoro. 

Blizzard didnt invent game addicts, but Warcraft certainly has increased the sample size of idiots and basement dwellers that I have to interact with. Next some clock tower loony will shoot somebody with &quot;an epic rifle&quot;, and we&#039;ll see more popular press rants about evils of games. Meh.

Can we get all these fools to play on the one server, and then close transfers from it? Like Survivor mixed with Jerry Springer.

He was a healer for crying out loud... no doubt the guild gave resources for him to get up in levels... then he off and quits for something like &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Schoolwork&quot; ... bah! those will be there on Tuesday Mornings... Pleanty of time during patches!

J/k of course :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m seeing a lot more stories about game addiction and games causing violence.  It seems the Montreal Shootings and the recent passing of the CAMRA Act has stirred up the media.

Here Are My Thoughts on the Matter:
