					<description><![CDATA[The worst part of this whole deal for us RP-people on the RP andRPPVP-servers is that we are forced to fight our battlegrounds together with hardcore PVP-ers who ruin our gaming experience.

They have names like &quot;KUKISKALLEN&quot; (Swedish for &quot;Penis in the head&quot;), kebab, br√É¬∂drosten (Swedish for &quot;Toaster&quot;), Iloveporn, jlojhlflllofjo and other shitty names that should be banned. 

They also ruin the gaming experience by calling everyone noob and yelling things in leetspeak as well calling out improper sentences.

Please Blizzard! Isolate the RP-servers cross-realm battlegrounds from the PVP- and Normal servers! let RP-people play with RP-people, undisturbed bu raging hardcore PVP-ers who ruin the game for us!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[X realm Bg&#039;s I think are good as lots of PvP but I liked it better before as we could make good groupes and go against horde who we knew instead of going against random people who we don&#039;t care about at all. Is there any way you could just like merge the realms? (not to big ofc) but I would really like it back to the way it was so we can battle our friends. I know a lot of people who have stopped PvP as of these X realm Bgs but I am feeling on doing the same now. Going against random peole bores me. I want the thrilling feeling when the other faction makes a char and /w you &quot;man your really good in BG&quot; and then they and others fee=ar you:P Really funny hehe.

So.... all im asking is &quot;BRING back the old PvP! and Bring back our PEOPLE&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[good guildname. pissing people off is kinda childish. and finally. Dont let bloody elves into the Horde!! And kill every shammy that will work for the alliance. kill them dead. and corpsecamp them forever. bleeding traitors!

distributing pallies and shammies to both factions is bad call. whats the difference between horde and alliance then? only graphics. :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hahahah that was an enlightening and amusing read, especially about AV.

					<description><![CDATA[Honestly Shaman are not that pwnage...

isn&#039;t that SO last year...?? Especially after Pally tweaking...

Besides Endgame contents WILL be easier when we can get healers and decursers that wear plate and bubble you of trouble for 12 sec.

Then we get more of the good gear to compliment our leet skills ;)

But honestly most of TBC is gonna ruin so many aspects of the game. 

gorram it Blizzard, you didn&#039;t... you just didn&#039;t

sorry for going of topic :P

					<description><![CDATA[The most curious thing about x-server battlegrounds that occurred in my battlegroup was the change in AV playstyle.

Previously it used to be a giant clusterfuck in the middle, with one side pushing forward but then losing ground to the other, back and forth, for hours upon hours. Alliance typically lost more often than it won and it was excruciatingly painful to play.

Then x-server hit and it changed overnight. Alliance rushes for Captain Galv and proceeds onward, while Horde rushes for Captain Whatever-Her-Name-Is. A few players on each side hang back to play defence, but it&#039;s basically 30 people on offense and it&#039;s a race to see who can zerg the quickest.

Occasionally you come across a game where people still play the old way and it&#039;s a multiple hour exercise in turtling and futility, but otherwise games take less than 20 minutes and it&#039;s huge amounts of rep all around.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[meh, just got tired of it.  Yes, that was the old Maxell ad.  I think everyone&#039;s big brother had that poster in their college dorm rooms.  I think my big brother STILL has that poster somewhere.

I&#039;ll probably bring it back some day, but I&#039;m (slowly) working on a new site design so Maxell dude is shelved for now.]]></description>
