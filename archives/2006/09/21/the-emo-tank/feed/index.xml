					<description><![CDATA[On my server there are cases of this.  I usually don&#039;t let them.
The moment I suspect someone is going to go Emo during any sort of situation, I cut them off and start taking command of the situation.  
Our guild has no emo at all.  The guild leader has a strict policy on members, and will boot on command, should the problem continue.  No beggers, no complaints.  
I did know someone like ET2 though.  Ran a group into ZF, and this guy was to be our main tank (and my main support).  He need-rolled half the drops, even if they were cloth, then opened every grave and caused a very bad wipe.  He appologized for it, saying he never ran ZF before.  He then logged off.  One other party member told us that he had partied with this warrior the night before to run ZF.
I say we black-ball the emo&#039;s.  Give them a permanent mark in the armory so we know what we&#039;re dealing with.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This was already far too funny until one of the comments pushed it over the top, the one comment where your tank (or mages, or hunters, etc) start asking about dps or damage meters.

It still has me laughing.

The &#039;new&#039; standard reply is &quot;no, go run your own damage meter&quot;

hahahhhahaha, tanks asking about their dps.]]></description>
