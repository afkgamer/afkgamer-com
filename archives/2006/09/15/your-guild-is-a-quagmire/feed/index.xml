					<description><![CDATA[Respond to every tell with either &quot;hmm&quot;, &quot;right on&quot;, or &quot;lol&quot; and you will soon find that every single person that talks to you considers you their best friend. They will then whine about all their problems to you. Dont respond with anything longer than the previously mentioned responses! OR drama be thy fate]]></description>
