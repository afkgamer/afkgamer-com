					<description><![CDATA[Many UO fans would agree that the game hit its peak about 7 years ago shortly before the Renaissance patch that introduced Trammel, I think they should just let it die.  

The game that we loved has been gone for a long, long time......unless you play on one of throwback freeshards, then it&#039;s all good.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I took a peek at UO last week out of curiosity - name and gender change tokens for the low, low price of $34.99!

Yay upselling!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting. UO had one NGE back when the Age of Shadows expansion came out. I think that one worked well, except for the fact that it wasn&#039;t AT ALL designed with long-term play in mind. No item decay   Artifacts that explicitly broke their own design parameters = dead crafting and a combat system that has collapsed under its own weight. Word is they&#039;ve brought the crafting system back to some sort of relevance. They&#039;re bringing back the dynamic scenarios too. If they fix the combat system so that it&#039;s not so item dependent any more then I just might have to re-sub and check things out.]]></description>
