					<description><![CDATA[It wasn&#039;t a stealth nerf, was listed in the patch notes plain and simple. I think the biggest hunter nerf this patch was that most Cat pets sound like WOLVES!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Even as a NE Hunter I thought that stealth   aimed shot might have been a little abusive.  But in practice I can just make sure you&#039;re turned the other way before I draw down on you from ambush.  Only player that will see you on the scope will be another hunter, and he 1) has to be paying close attention to the scope, 2) damn sure isn&#039;t going to charge you.

The real nerfs that are chapping my ass as a hunter are the visible flare nerf and the stealth vs. hidden trap nerf.  Not that any rogue with any sense isn&#039;t aware that I&#039;m standing on a trap, but now there&#039;s _no_ chance a 60 isn&#039;t gonna see it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Actually, that is aimed at nelf hunters, who had the sweet setup of Shadowmeld -&#062; Aimed Shot. It was like Ambush from a Rogue, but from 41 yards away... The Rogues actually made out quite nicely, as many people are reporting that poisons can be applied without breaking stealth. Cheap Shot and Slice and Dice also got fixed so the Rogue whining should be at normal levels.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m surprised no one has noticed the stealth nerf. LOL, I crack meself up. Yeah, stealth now comes down at the beginning of any action rather than the end. I don&#039;t play a rogue, but that sounds like that could be a huge nerf. Won&#039;t that impact raid strategies?]]></description>
