					<description><![CDATA[This has some legs.  My guild is docking everyone &quot;negative 50 DKP&quot;; we have a couple of people working on their voice impersonations in Vent; any misstep = &quot;it&#039;s not even fucking remotely imaginable!&quot;

Until that guild/raid leader asserts their/his copyright, we should all try to get a piece of the action.  Is Negative50dkp.com available?  (hey, it is!)]]></description>
