					<description><![CDATA[Some of the tier 0.5 gear is actually pretty nice.  I know the rogue head is a bit better than the Niteslayer Cap in both appearance and in my opinion overall stats.  Is it worth it?  I think so.

The Onyxia is Serious audio is edited to only include the relative pieces.  Otherwise you&#039;d have a 30 minute or so audio clip there with much of it being silence or not funny at all.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The new 1.10 content is tiny: two new encounters in existing dungeons.  There&#039;s a new Arena event in BRD, and a new boss in UBRS.  That&#039;s it.

You can run Stratholme Undead in 45 minutes with a group of five right now, if you like.  There&#039;s no new strategies to learn, it&#039;s the same set of pulls it&#039;s been since its nerfing after it was reduced to a 10-man from a 40-man.  If you&#039;re raiding MC , there&#039;s nothing there you want now, and there will be nothing there you want post-1.10 either.

TheeNickster, the Onyxia is Serious clip is a staged audio clip, not a real raid.  Real raid dramas involve MANY more people screaming over Vent. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Anyways. I can sum up my opinion of the Tier 0.5 armor quests in two words: Start raiding. Less time, less bother (and I did not think that was possible), better gear in a raiding guild. We&#039;re talkin&#039; by a HUGE margin here.

There&#039;s other alternatives, of course: Learn2BuyGold. Wait around for them to design Dire Maul version 2 with epic armor. Preorder the expansion because I bet level 70s could kick the shit out of Molten Core. And the ole standby, quit.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
An excellent summary! I agree. I chose the ole standby and quit yesterday, though not precisely for those reasons and I didn&#039;t know about the material requirements then.

I was looking forward to the new challenge in the old 5-man instances, which will finally be limited to 5-man as I thought they always should have been. But then I started making inquiries among guildmates and friends ... and found out that if I did these new challenges I&#039;d be doing them in PUGs. You see, my entire friends list has become a list of players who only log on when a raid is scheduled and these players see no merit in all in the new content and rewards. They can get better stuff (or have already gotten much better stuff) much easier and more quickly in MC/BWL/AQ. As for guildmates ... those who aren&#039;t raiding and therefore fall into the aforementioned &quot;not interested&quot; group aren&#039;t hardcore enough to face the new challenges. Ironically, they&#039;re too casual for this new &quot;casual&quot; content.

Now if this patch had come out a year ago things might have been different. But it&#039;s too little, much too late. Alas, the WoW endgame remains the same: raid, grind til your eyes bleed, or quit. It&#039;s been speculated before, but looking over the requirements and rewards I have to seriously wonder if Blizzard&#039;s hidden motive is to convince non-raiders that raiding is actually the more casual choice to make.

If so, it may backfire as many, like me, give up and quit instead.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Seriously, fuck these Tier 0 pieces of shit.

Not worth the effort, and certainly not worth it for casual gamers.

Guess what non-raiders?  Wait for the expansion, then maybe you&#039;ll get to play the rest of the content you&#039;re paying for!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The solution to the PuG ninja looting problem is easier than instituting a mass DKP system. WoW&#039;s original builders invented something called a &quot;quest item&quot; that you could only see and loot if you were on a certain quest. Better yet, if multiple people in the same group, each would get their own quest item to play with.

Instead of collecting the old quest armor you could collect a series of stackable quest items that only drop in the tier 0 instances. Too bad the new designers don&#039;t know what a quest item is...]]></description>
