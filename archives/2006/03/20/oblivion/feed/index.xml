					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with you Staarkhand. I tried my hardest to like Morrowind, but couldn&#039;t succeed. The story was incredibly boring and while it&#039;s nice to have a wide open environment to explore, wandering aimlessly isn&#039;t much fun. What especially soured me was that in the very beginning i could go around picking up enough to stuff to be outfitted in full plate before I ever left the first town.

I&#039;m going to sit this one out for awhile. I don&#039;t have an xbox 360 yet and although my pc could probably handle it, it wouldn&#039;t like it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t decide on this one.  I love RPGs, and I really wanted to like Morrowind... but after no fewer than three failed attempts to play that game I&#039;ve finally admitted that it&#039;s boring, lifeless, and has the worst combat ever imagined.  

I think the intro plot was lifted straight from the ProgressQuest prologue.  The cities achieved the uncanny valley of being just rich enough to encourage exploration without being able to stand up to it.  Every NPC is a one-dimensional caricature smoldering with some generic emotion.  My favorite part was caracter creation, because at that point I could still fool myself into thinking all those skills mattered because the game was actually playable.

So then I quit after about 15-20 hours, take some time off, then read about how everyone on the internet thinks it&#039;s the best RPG ever invented and eventually I pick it up again and start the cycle anew.

I guess I&#039;m holding off on Oblivion until I can determine it&#039;s not just an iteration on a game I didn&#039;t like.  Although I&#039;m not sure how that will happen since I&#039;m like the only person in the world who doesn&#039;t love Morrowind.  I think I need a support group.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Isn&#039;t your current guild the one that allows you DKP just for being online even if you don&#039;t end up in one of the raids?  My solution would be to keep WoW running AFK while playing Oblivion.  I need to go check this game out.  Unfortunately, I just bought my XBox360 last week so I&#039;ve already used up my WKP (Wife Kindness Points).  Looks like I&#039;ll have to go through a few months of real life RAIDs (Really Angel, I&#039;ll Doit) before I have enough points to get this game.]]></description>
