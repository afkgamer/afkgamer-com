					<description><![CDATA[Preach it about DKP.  There are several implementations out there, some better than others (zero sum fanboi here), but I absolutely LOVE the arguments against it.

The classic
1.  You raided for 3 months without reward while I was still leveling up, it&#039;s not fair that you should get an item first.

On a similiar line of thought
2.  You contribute 10x as much to our guild&#039;s raids, it&#039;s not fair that you should get an item first (hi2u rob).

One recently making a strong showing is
3.  I got 6/8 of my tier 1 set on a single raid because everything was defaulted to me, I&#039;m being punished by having negative points because now I can&#039;t compete on tier 2 items for AT LEAST a month.

Almost everything that gets put out there under the pretense of saying DKP is not fair is either misunderstanding or just old-fashioned loot-whore-ism.  If fair means having to wait your turn, then fair isn&#039;t what you want.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[By your own admission, you weren&#039;t showing up to raids.  You don&#039;t want to wait in line behind the people that did show up?  This is an indictment of DKP systems how?  

Sounds like it&#039;s working as intended.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;The DKP Haters. WTF, how can you hate math?&quot;
No, the problem is I *CAN* do the math.
Math says I need to spend 3 months waiting in line while other people get their upgrades first. 

And in my experiance the only people that like DKP are the ones that use it to get their shit first. These are usually the people that never miss a raid. Hell, they only log in to raid. They also rank high on my /afk meter because they are watching movies and such. But hey, how else are you suppose to squeeze in quality time with the wife and not miss a single dkp point?

Random is fine and fair, but leadership doesnt like fair. They like control, they like quiet.

If you go on enough raids you&#039;ll eventually get something using dkp or random. Random ensures a random loot distribution, dkp forms a waiting line.

These lines are great too, wait 3 months to build up enough dkp to compete for items and your competition already has theirs. Youll finally get your shit, but then they begin stockpiling dkp so when new shit comes, they again get first dibs.

Moreover, DKP slows down raid progression and demoralizes raid members.
I watched my pants get sharded because I needed to save my dkp for a chance at the toep. When it did drop and I lost the roll (and thats fine, least i had a shot), but the pants just added insult to injury. Guild bank gets a shard, I keep my dkp for another day and my dps suffers.

Also I hate my leadership making up rules about DKP as they go along and threatening to take it away whenever it suits their mood.

Got my purples like a real man, rank 13 bitch.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;2. My guild&#039;s rogues. DKP-hoarding bastards, spend some of that DKP on the rotting rogue endgame armor instead of saving up for some Weapon of the Gods that drops .0001 percent of the time, according to Thottbot, which means it NEVER DROPS.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fire those idiots. They are hurting the raid by letting stuff rot while pining after Bindings (I&#039;m guessing that&#039;s what a lot of them are after). Or, force the highest one to take and spend his points. That kind of behavior is just stupid.

Oh, and did I mention I have a 60 Rogue somewhere I&#039;d be glad to bring along? ;)]]></description>
