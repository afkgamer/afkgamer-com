					<description><![CDATA[Short of CT Mods action bars and the Auctioneer, I think just about every mod I regularly use is going to be broken.  Of course, I never bound Decursive to movement keys:  I macroed it on the hotbar where God intended it to be.  Still, I&#039;m a heavy user of Decursive, Castparty, SCT, etc., since I play a Priest most of the time.  I&#039;m not really looking forward to this patch, and neither is my wife (who&#039;s ready to spit bullets over making Scholo/Strat/BRD five-man only).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You missed out on the best part of the 1.10 &#039;epics&#039; -- they suck.  One piece was held up as &quot;why is this piece decent, while others suck?&quot;, that piece being the Paladin gloves.  Blizzard&#039;s response was to nerf the Paladin gloves, heh.

http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-realm-test&#038;t=160374&#038;s=blizzard&#038;tmp=1#blizzard

&quot;Regarding the Dungeon 2 set gauntlets... the Soulforge Gauntlets were unfortunately a bit higher level than intended and are being brought down to the proper level. This may have skewed your initial comparison somewhat, and I apologize.&quot;

What I hate is that the new set is still not an improvement over top of the line pre-ZG gear.  It&#039;s still not even ilvl 65 -- it&#039;s gear designed for characters who aren&#039;t level 60 yet.  The ol&#039; &quot;raid or quit&quot; message gets stronger all the time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m of two minds with the ui changes.  On the one hand, ManaConserve and the version of Decursive bound to movement keys were big crutches.  But then, priests aren&#039;t exactly a lazy or skill-less class, and they really do have a lot on their plates.  The change to not allow casting decurse when it&#039;s not needed might make some encounters (Chromaggus) easier, we&#039;ll see.

I won&#039;t comment on the &#039;my $15 means I deserve epics even if I never log in&#039; debate, it&#039;s a no win.  I see it as the way that makes sense and is fair vs the way that a whole lot of people paying $$ want, in other words no self-respecting developer would ever make the right decision.]]></description>
