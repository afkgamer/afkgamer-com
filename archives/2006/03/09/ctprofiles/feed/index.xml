					<description><![CDATA[I will say this for the CT guys: I haven&#039;t seen profiles in other places nearly often as I am seeing their profiles linked. From the forum trolling I do, within a week of the release I was seeing 10% of the players with those profiles. That&#039;s not a big number, but I sure don&#039;t remember seeing that for RPGOutfitter or WoW PM or WoW Guru.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Played with it a bit now.  No hover, as you said.  That sucks.  I had no problems with speed, but this was late in the day.

Seemed accurate for my character, equipment, talents, all add up to the correct HP, resist, etc. totals.

EDIT:  I&#039;m blind.  You can hover the item stats by clicking the checkbox &quot;Show tooltips on hover&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It fairly slow (at work), about the same as RPG Outfitter or WoW PM.  It doesn&#039;t do the hover inspect (click instead).  It&#039;s still faster than Allakhazam, though.

I still like WoW Roster, although that&#039;s single-site only.]]></description>
