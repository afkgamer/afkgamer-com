		<p>Now available, the REAL WoW Patch 1.12.0 notes &#8212; cut and paste job after the jump.  (<a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/test-realm-patchnotes.html">link</a> &#8211; NOT futureproof)  The Public Test Realms are open for business, either come as you are or use a premade 60.</p>
<p><span id="more-1168"></span><strong>World of Warcraft Client Patch</strong><br />
(Disclaimer: These patch notes are for the Public Test Realm and the content of the patch is subject to change.)</p>
<p><strong>World of Warcraft Public Test Patch 1.12.0<br />
Cross-Realm Battlegrounds<br />
</strong><br />
      For the first time in the history of World of Warcraft, you will be able to face off against players from other realms in the Battlegrounds. PvP Battlegrounds link Alterac Valley, Warsong Gulch, and Arathi Basin so that players from several realms will be combined into one huge matchmaking pool. Replenish your mana, sharpen your blades, and get ready for some brand-new challengers! </p>
<p><strong>World PvP</strong></p>
<p>      The stage is set for intense, objective-based land battles as Horde and Alliance vie for control over important strategic positions and resources around Azeroth. Head out for Silithus and Eastern Plaguelands to engage the enemy on the field! </p>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<p>    * Threat Reduction Effects<br />
          o This system has been redesigned to eliminate inconsistency in how the effects work. Previously, some were additive (for example: 30% reduction + 20% reduction = 50% reduction) while others were multiplicative (30% reduction and 20% reduction made 44% reduction, from 0.7*0.8). They are now all multiplicative. This also prevents unpredictable behavior when the total reduction percentage was equal to or greater than 100%. Please note that in almost all cases, when stacking multiple threat reduction effects you will experience less threat reduction than previously.<br />
    * Haste and Slow effects<br />
          o Previously Haste and Slow effects worked inconsistently, with spells working differently from weapons, and hastes and slows not acting as inverses of each other. We have revised the system so that all haste and slow effects work the same way, and haste and slow percentages of the same magnitude perfectly cancel each other out (30% haste and 30% slow combine to no change). As a result, we had to change the tooltip numbers on all spell haste effects, and on all melee and range slow effects. The numbers in the tooltips are different, but the game functionality is unchanged (other than slight rounding errors). Those tooltips that changed will now display larger numbers than they used to display. Conceptually, haste values indicate how much more of that activity you can perform in a given time. 30% melee haste means 30% more swings in a given time. Slow values indicate how much longer an activity takes to complete. 30% slow means an action takes 30% longer to finish.<br />
    * The deserter debuff will now continue to expire even while you are offline. </p>
<p><strong>Druids</strong></p>
<p>    * Barkskin: The tooltip has been changed to 25% due to the haste effect change.<br />
    * Ferocious Bite: The Book of Ferocious Bite (Rank 5) now drops somewhere in the world.<br />
    * Furor: This talent now works correctly with Cat Form again.<br />
    * Improved Shred: The discounted cost for Shred will now be displayed correctly even when you are not in Cat Form.<br />
    * Rip: Lesser potency Rips will no longer overwrite greater potency ones. </p>
<p><strong>Hunters</strong></p>
<p>    * Spirit Bond: This ability will now be correctly reapplied when you resurrect in a battleground and your pet is polymorphed or otherwise unable to act normally. </p>
<p><strong>Mages</strong></p>
<p>    * Arcane Missiles: It is no longer possible to cast this spell on an evading mob. In addition, the animation will now stop when the target is dead.<br />
    * Arcane Power: It is no longer possible to gain the benefit of this spell and Power Infusion at the same time by careful timing.<br />
    * Frost Armor Chilled effect: The tooltip has been changed to 25% due to the haste effect change.<br />
    * Ice Armor Chilled effect: The tooltip has been changed to 25% due to the haste effect change.<br />
    * Polymorph: This spell will now be removed when a player leaves a battleground. This prevents some bugs involving polymorph from occurring.<br />
    * Evocation will no longer be usable while silenced. </p>
<p><strong>Paladins</strong></p>
<p>    * Divine Shield: The tooltip has been changed to 100% due to the haste effect change. </p>
<p><strong>Priests</strong></p>
<p>    * Mind Control: The tooltip has been changed to 25% due to the haste effect change.<br />
    * Psychic Scream: This spell now uses the same resistance checks as the Warlock spell Fear. </p>
<p><strong>Rogues</strong></p>
<p>    * Due to significant talent changes, Rogues will have all talent points refunded and can be re-spent. Training costs for all talent spell replacements have been significantly reduced.<br />
    * Eviscerate: Manual of Eviscerate (Rank 9) now drops somewhere in the world.<br />
    * Garrote: The damage from this ability has been increased approximately 50%.<br />
    * Relentless Strikes: This ability will no longer trigger when your finishing move does not hit your target.<br />
    * Sap: Enemy rogues will now always lose stealth when you Sap them. </p>
<p><strong>Shaman</strong></p>
<p>    * Grounding Totem: This totem will no longer absorb multiple effects from Entrapment in a 10 second period.<br />
    * Windfury Totem: The weapon enchantment from this totem will now only trigger off normal melee swings. This means abilities such as Sinister Strike, Mortal Strike, and Hamstring will no longer trigger the Windfury Totem.<br />
    * Reincarnation should now display the cooldown timer when used.<br />
    * Chain Heal &#8211; After the initial target is healed, the healing effect will jump to the most damaged target (by absolute health) within range. In addition, if a raid member is the initial target it will look for valid raid targets to jump to rather than non-raid targets as a priority, making it consistent with group targeted Chain Heals. </p>
<p><strong>Warlocks</strong></p>
<p>    * Cripple (Doomguard): The tooltip has been changed to 45% due to the haste effect change.<br />
    * Enslave Demon: The tooltip has been changed to 40% due to the haste effect change.<br />
    * Health Funnel: This spell will now work correctly on low-level enslaved demons.<br />
    * Howl of Terror: This spell now uses the same resistance checks as the Warlock spell Fear.<br />
    * Siphon Life will now properly gain a benefit from Shadow Mastery. </p>
<p><strong>Warriors</strong></p>
<p>    * Flurry: The text on the tooltip has been corrected to indicate it triggers on all types of attacks.<br />
    * Shield Slam: This ability will sometimes no longer remove more than one beneficial effect from the target.<br />
    * Sword Specialization: This ability can no longer trigger off of itself. </p>
<p><strong>Items</strong></p>
<p>    * +30 Spell Damage Enchantment: Fixed a bug with this enchantment which was preventing it from benefiting healing spells.<br />
    * Blade of Eternal Darkness: The triggered effect from this weapon will no longer occur when the spell being cast has its effect broken by causing damage.<br />
    * Blazefury Medallion: The triggered effect from this item will no longer break Gouge.<br />
    * Bonescythe Armor: The Eviscerate bonus will no longer trigger when your Eviscerate does not hit your target.<br />
    * Darkmoon Card- Twisting Nether: The dialog for this resurrection will now always reappear after the Spirit of Redemption effect has completed.<br />
    * Eye of the Dead: Holy Shock now interacts properly with this item.<br />
    * Ranged Elemental Damage: Our ranged combat system does not allow a ranged weapon to do a mix of Elemental (Fire, Frost, Arcane, etc.) and Physical damage. Many ranged weapons existed which were listed as doing Elemental damage and did not function properly (the damage was dealt, but was treated as Physical). All of those weapons have been changed to deliver the Elemental damage as a chance on hit effect. Hurricane was previously changed this way in 1.11. The following ranged weapons are also fixed in 1.12: Bow of Searing Arrows, Dwarven Hand Cannon, Heartseeking Crossbow, Dark Iron Rifle, Galgann&#8217;s Fireblaster, Quillshooter, Shell Launcher Shotgun, Venomstrike, and Verdant Keeper&#8217;s Aim.<br />
    * Talisman of Ascendance: This item will no longer trigger from physical damage effects. In addition, if either of the buffs from the item are cancelled, they will both be cancelled.<br />
    * Zandalarian Hero Charm: Item tooltip corrected to match the effect tooltip.<br />
    * The Items that summon mounts have been changed in their color/quality. Items that summon normal mounts are now blue(superior)items and items that summon swift mounts are now purple(epic) items.<br />
    * Fixed a bug that allowed you to use items which restored health or mana while you were already full health or mana.<br />
    * Fixed a bug with the Jom Gabbar trinket which was causing it to trigger a category cooldown for a duration longer than intended.<br />
    * Fixed a bug that prevented Arcane Missiles from being able to trigger the effect of Wrath of Cenarius.<br />
    * Clarified the tooltips for the Stormshroud armor and Kalimdor&#8217;s Revenge to explain that they deal Nature damage.<br />
    * Fixed a bug that caused the Blooddrenched Mask to hide a character&#8217;s hair.<br />
    * Warbear leather now stacks to 20. </p>
<p><strong>Professions</strong></p>
<p>    * Engineering: The damage from sapper charges can now be resisted. The overall DPS of the charges should not be significantly altered from what it currently is.<br />
    * Engineering: Explosive sheep do fire damage instead of physical damage. </p>
<p><strong>Raids and Dungeons</strong></p>
<p>    * Uldaman<br />
          o Reduced the number of Shadowforge Ambushers that attack after looting the quest chest.<br />
          o Shadowforge Ambushers are no longer elite.<br />
          o The respawn of the Stone Stewards has been changed to 2 hours (from 30 minutes).<br />
    * Zul&#8217;Farrak<br />
          o The respawn of the 2 Troll/1 Basilisk patrollers should now be 2 hours.<br />
          o Reduced the damage dealt by the Sul&#8217;lithuz Abomination and Sul&#8217;lithuz Sandcrawler.<br />
          o Zul&#8217;Farrak Dead Heroes are no longer elites.<br />
          o Theka the Martyr will now only remain immune to physical damage for 30 seconds before reverting to normal.<br />
          o Antu&#8217;sul&#8217;s Sul&#8217;lithuz Broodlings now only hatch 4 at a time and are significantly weaker.<br />
          o Witch Doctor Zum&#8217;rah will no longer call as many Zul&#8217;Farrak Zombies to his aid when aggroed.<br />
          o Weegli Blastfuse now has slightly more hit points.<br />
          o Antu&#8217;sul&#8217;s Warden no longer attempts to knock adventurers into Antu&#8217;sul&#8217;s lair.<br />
          o Sandfury Cretins who engage the party during the pyramid event are no longer able to cast shadow bolt.<br />
    * Maraudon<br />
          o Noxxious Scions will no longer spawn when you cleanse Celebrian Vines. </p>
<p><strong>User Interface</strong></p>
<p>    * V key functionality has been improved in several ways.<br />
          o V key now shows summoned monsters (such as the gargoyles in Stratholme.)<br />
          o V key now shows both monsters and player enemies.<br />
          o V now shows enemies only (no longer shows friendly targets.)<br />
          o Shift-V now shows friendly targets only, not enemies (with a new bindable hotkey.)<br />
          o Control-V shows both friendly targets and enemy targets (with a new bindable hotkey.)<br />
    * New floating combat text has been added to the game with a number of options. You can see when you take damage, when you are healed and how much, when you acquire and lose auras and much more. You can turn on the new options in the newly revised options screen.<br />
    * The Need Before Greed and Group Loot countdown timers will now have a 3 minute countdown when there is a bind on acquire item on the corpse. This should allow a bit more time in making a decision to roll for an item.<br />
    * Automatic Quest Tracking has been added to the game and is turned on by default. Any time you advance a quest by advancing one of the requirements, the quest information will appear on your screen for 5 minutes before fading. You can turn this option off from the options screen.<br />
    * There is now a confirmation dialogue when you attempt to disband your guild. </p>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<p>    * Fixed a bug that caused some non-combat pets to be referred to as Minions instead of Pets. Mini Diablo however has escaped this fate and will continue to be referred to as a Minion. </p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>* New floating combat text has been added to the game with a number of options. You can see when you take damage, when you are healed and how much, when you acquire and lose auras and much more. You can turn on the new options in the newly revised options screen. *</p>
<p>And they copy ANOTHER addon&#8230;..wonder if they will ever give recognition to the people who actually made this addon popular.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Heh, I laughed at that when I read it too.  Scrolling Combat Text is a great mod, much more useful than I thought it would be when I first installed it &#8212; I&#8217;m not surprised that WoW is <del>stealing</del> copying it.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>actually have you ever looked that interface customization board?<br />
The designers work closly with the mod designers there, and many mod designers are more than happy to give Blizzard their Code.<br />
a few people of the CT team have already been hired by Blizzard or other MMO firms, the kind of recognition those (successfull) mod teams have is rather high, in the industry</p>
