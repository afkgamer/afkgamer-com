					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;This isn&#039;t EQ (in this manner) where warriors hit Autoattack, lean back in their chairs and do whatever ... ahem ... they would do while slapping some sense into Lord Nagafen.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ah reminds me of Vyemm fight for rogues in eq ... I could go afk for 15 mins get some food and come back and still stabbing that fat bastard in the back.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Voice chat for raiding seems like a no brainer. What I hate about voice chat is that guilds (in WoW, anyway) seem to be turning it into a replacement for the guild chat. I don&#039;t mind listening to my guildmates during a raid, but I&#039;ll quit before I put up with listening to them babble on about god-knows-what during my regular play times. But with guild chat getting quieter as more basic discussion moves to voice chat it makes me long for the pre-chat days.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We use it, but don&#039;t require it... at least not yet.  Granted, the guild I&#039;m in is fairly new at raiding, so maybe in a few months it&#039;ll be a requirement....  OTOH, the guild leaders are opposed to requiring anybody to spec talents in any particular way, so it may just get highly suggested to get on the TS server and not become a requirement.]]></description>
