Its a buff, no doubt about it, but the whining from the rogues running UBRS in all blues will still continue as it is rather small in the case of eviscerate and it is unknown whether they will be able to get the Rank 9 book (for less than 2k gold that is).

The real thing to watch is Rupture. It scales now and has Serrated Blades to give it 30% more damage. If it is given the ability to critical, then this very much puts hemo in the PvE possible category. No, you will not own the damage meters with that. But overall raid dps should increase by  reasonable margin.]]></description>
