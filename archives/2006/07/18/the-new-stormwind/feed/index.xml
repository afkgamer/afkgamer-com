					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d agree, the PVP twink situation is ridiculous.  I would guess that Blizzard would address this soon, either by forcing experience on the level 19s or nerfing enchants.  

If x-server battlegrounds provide relief for the lengthy level 60 BG queues (which I very much doubt, high alliance to horde ratio is fairly universal across all servers), I&#039;m sure most of the twinks will lose interest and return to 60 PVP -- almost equally as ridiculous, by the way, with the level 60 equipment gap.  

I am a dick, but I don&#039;t run around thinking I&#039;ve pwned anyone with my superior 19 (or 60) gear.  My gear pwns people, I&#039;m just driving it over people.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So you and your kind are the reason I can&#039;t PvP till I&#039;m 60?

WoW is a raiders game, and your raiding which I will never get to in terms of necessary items, armor or what not now also fucks up my low level pvp.

WoW has so gone beyone everquest in catering for fucktards.

You sir, are a dick, but I guess you already knew that.

What I just said would have meaning if I were still playing. As it stands, gimme funny twink stories!

Oh, and fuck you and you kind for ruining WoW lower levels!

As much satire as this is, foton, yer still a dick =)]]></description>
