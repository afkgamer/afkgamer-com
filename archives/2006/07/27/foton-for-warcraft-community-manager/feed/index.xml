					<description><![CDATA[It should be noted that 30k in Southern California is probably close to the poverty line...


I&#039;m rather surprised that they listed the &quot;we own you&quot; requirement (24/7/365 on call? whee!)...does anyone REALLY want to work a job that&#039;s gaurenteed to get abuse from both the players AND your bosses?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll hazard.  30k?  And that is a wild guess.  Typical entry level glam position salary.  I have no idea of course, but people would go cheap to get a foot in the door.

EDIT:  The ridiculous prior experience is a wild card.  Exactly how many people do they think have 3-5 years exp as Comm Mgr in the gaming industry?  I wager that is negotiable, but the 30k isn&#039;t.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Any Americans want to hazard a guess as what something like that would actually pay? Or are we talking a &#039;One (1) Free World of Warcraft Account&#039; type salary there? Seems like quite an extensive list there for being a message board mod.

(I&#039;m not interested in applying mind you...I consistently spell colour and armour wrong, so wouldn&#039;t have a chance!)]]></description>
