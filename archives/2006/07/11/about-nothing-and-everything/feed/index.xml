					<description><![CDATA[I would guess certain classes are prone to dramatics because they can.  Would your guild hesitate for even a second in booting Rogue49 for demanding an UBRS item?  Mine wouldn&#039;t.

I&#039;ve sometimes wondered if people that are hard to get along with purposely roll critical classes because they would be unguildable otherwise.  Which came first, the priest/cleric or the diva?  The world may never know.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmmm....we had a spot of guild drama last night, and it was a priest (and warrior friend) who were at the heart of it.  Seems she got pissed that another healer had the *audacity* to roll against her (and win) on some item that dropped in UBRS.  

The warrior /gguit .... and the guild leader (on an alt) asked the priest (not the one who got the item, mind) if she wanted to quit or if he should log onto his main and boot her....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good news for the /lfg folks - the latest patch is supposed to not make that channel &quot;on by default&quot; anymore.

Also good to see you back and posting Foton.  What is up with healers often (not always, but often) turning out to be the biggest drama queening, attention-whoring, troublemakers to the Nth degree?  Tanks and DPS types don&#039;t nearly seem to cause that much trouble ...]]></description>
