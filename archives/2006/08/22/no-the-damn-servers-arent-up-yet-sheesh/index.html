(Future generations:  this is a spoof on the recently released movie, <em>Snakes on a Plane</em>, starring Samuel L. Jackson.  I have to say that or else I&#8217;ll see this a year later and wonder why I ever thought this was hilarious.)</p>
<p>In another thread, Camule, of an unknown realm (because the forum logins are messed right now for maintenance), asked players to recount their World of Warcraft sins and transgressions in <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-general&#038;t=9599329">&#8220;What&#8217;s the worse thing you&#8217;ve ever done in game?&#8221;</a>, amply proving that human beings are not of divine origin.  Thank you for that, because I still had some hope.</p>
<p>Looking at the <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/pvp/battlegrounds/battlegroups.html">battlegroups for the cross-server battlegrounds</a>, I see that my server will be grouped with my former SWG guild&#8217;s server.  (Later, I&#8217;ll go trash talk on their boards to start building a little rivalry.)  I expect that initially, my current guild will get our asses handed to us by the PVP-realm crowd, but I&#8217;m confident that with some minimal practice, superior gear will win the day.  Of course, I will claim this is SKILL because I do have an ego.</p>
<p>Lastly, desperate for a Patch 1.12 mirror?  <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Patch_mirrors">Seek and ye shall find</a> at WoWWiki.  (<strong>WoW Raiders</strong>:  Update your <a href="http://ctmod.net/">CT-RaidAssist</a> also.  Don&#8217;t annoy your guild, like my guildmates will, by waiting until five minutes before the scheduled raid start time to do this.)</p>
<p>Official Patch 1.12 notes after jump:</p>
<p><span id="more-1194"></span><strong>Drums of War</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cross-Realm Battlegrounds</strong></p>
<p>      For the first time in the history of World of Warcraft, you will be able to face off against players from other realms in the Battlegrounds. PvP Battlegrounds link Alterac Valley, Warsong Gulch, and Arathi Basin so that players from several realms will be combined into one huge matchmaking pool. Replenish your mana, sharpen your blades, and get ready for some brand-new challengers! </p>
<p><strong>World PvP</strong></p>
<p>      The stage is set for intense, objective-based land battles as Horde and Alliance vie for control over important strategic positions and resources around Azeroth. Head out for Silithus and Eastern Plaguelands to engage the enemy on the field! </p>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<p>    * Threat Reduction Effects<br />
          o This system has been redesigned to eliminate inconsistency in how the effects work. Previously, some were additive (for example: 30% reduction + 20% reduction = 50% reduction) while others were multiplicative (30% reduction and 20% reduction made 44% reduction, from 0.7*0.8). They are now all multiplicative. This also prevents unpredictable behavior when the total reduction percentage was equal to or greater than 100%. Please note that in almost all cases, when stacking multiple threat reduction effects you will experience less threat reduction than previously.<br />
    * Haste and Slow effects<br />
          o Previously Haste and Slow effects worked inconsistently, with spells working differently from weapons, and hastes and slows not acting as inverses of each other. We have revised the system so that all haste and slow effects work the same way, and haste and slow percentages of the same magnitude perfectly cancel each other out (30% haste and 30% slow combine to no change). As a result, we had to change the tooltip numbers on all spell haste effects, and on all melee and range slow effects. The numbers in the tooltips are different, but the game functionality is unchanged (other than slight rounding errors). Those tooltips that changed will now display larger numbers than they used to display. Conceptually, haste values indicate how much more of that activity you can perform in a given time. 30% melee haste means 30% more swings in a given time. Slow values indicate how much longer an activity takes to complete. 30% slow means an action takes 30% longer to finish.<br />
    * The deserter debuff will now continue to expire even while you are offline.<br />
    * Honorable Kills now diminish at a rate 10% per kill rather than 25% per kill. </p>
<p><strong>Druids</strong></p>
<p>    * Barkskin: The tooltip has been changed to 25% due to the haste effect change.<br />
    * Cat Form: This form now has an innate threat reduction component.<br />
    * Ferocious Bite: Book of Ferocious Bite (Rank 5) now drops off The Beast in Black Rock Spire. In addition, Ferocious Bite now increases in potency with greater attack power.<br />
    * Furor: This talent now works correctly with Cat Form again.<br />
    * Improved Shred: The discounted cost for Shred will now be displayed correctly even when you are not in Cat Form.<br />
    * Rip: Lesser potency Rips will no longer overwrite greater potency ones.<br />
    * Fixed a bug where the incorrect sound was being played by the Claw attack. </p>
<p><strong>Hunters</strong></p>
<p>    * Spirit Bond: This ability will now be correctly reapplied when you resurrect in a battleground and your pet is polymorphed or otherwise unable to act normally.<br />
    * Improved Concussive Shot: The effect of this talent will now still be placed on the victim if the hunter is killed before their shot reaches the target.<br />
    * Growl now correctly initiates combat when used by a pet in passive mode.<br />
    * The Ferocity talent now correctly applies to non-physical hunter pet abilities such as Lightning Breath and Thunderstomp.<br />
    * If a hunter has tamed one of the following creature types, they will no longer potentially change colors if resummoned:<br />
          o Son of Hakkar &#8211; Red<br />
          o Frenzied Bloodseeker Bat &#8211; Brown<br />
          o Deep Stinger &#8211; Red<br />
          o Dark Screecher &#8211; Gray<br />
          o Cave Creeper &#8211; Brown<br />
          o Bloodaxe Worg &#8211; Black<br />
          o Scarshield Worg -Brown </p>
<p><strong>Mages</strong></p>
<p>    * Arcane Missiles: It is no longer possible to cast this spell on an evading mob. In addition, the animation will now stop when the target is dead.<br />
    * Arcane Power: It is no longer possible to gain the benefit of this spell and Power Infusion at the same time by careful timing.<br />
    * Frost Armor Chilled effect: Due to the haste effect change, the tooltip has been changed to 25%.<br />
    * Ice Armor Chilled effect: Due to the haste effect change, the tooltip has been changed to 25%.<br />
    * Ignite: The effect of this talent will now still be placed on the victim if the caster is killed before their spell reaches the target.<br />
    * Impact: The effect of this talent will now still be placed on the victim if the caster is killed before their spell reaches the target.<br />
    * Frostbite: The effect of this talent will now still be placed on the victim if the caster is killed before their spell reaches the target.<br />
    * Polymorph: This spell will now be removed when a player leaves a battleground. This prevents some bugs involving polymorph from occurring.<br />
    * Evocation will no longer be usable while silenced.<br />
    * Reduced the number of messages that appear in the combat log when using Combustion.<br />
    * Winter&#8217;s Chill: The effect of this talent will now still be placed on the victim if the caster is killed before their spell reaches the target. </p>
<p><strong>Paladins</strong></p>
<p>    * Divine Shield: Due to the haste effect change, the tooltip has been changed to 100%. </p>
<p><strong>Priests</strong></p>
<p>    * Mind Control: Due to the haste effect change, the tooltip has been changed to 25%.<br />
    * Psychic Scream: This spell now uses the same resistance checks as the Warlock spell Fear.<br />
    * Spirit of Redemption: Fixed an issue preventing Twisting Nether from retriggering when the Spirit of Redemption effect runs out. </p>
<p><strong>Rogues</strong></p>
<p>    * Due to significant talent changes, Rogues will have all talent points refunded and can be re-spent. Training costs for all talent spell replacements have been significantly reduced.<br />
    * Vanish now removes effects that allow the caster to always remain aware of their target (currently Hunter&#8217;s Mark and Mind Vision).<br />
    * Pickpocket can now be used on targets that are in combat, as long as the rogue remains stealthed.<br />
    * All manner of rogue reagents can be found in locked junkboxes (obtained from pickpocketing).<br />
    * Fixed a bug where the Slice and Dice ability wasn&#8217;t playing an animation.<br />
    * Lethargy Root has been removed from poison vendors and is now a gray item.<br />
    * Reduced the number of messages in the combat log when using the Vanish ability.<br />
    * Fixed a bug that made Combo Points disappear from your target when using Vanish.<br />
    * Eviscerate: Manual of Eviscerate (Rank 9) now drops off Blackhand Assassins in Black Rock Spire. In addition, Eviscerate now increases in potency with greater attack power.<br />
    * Garrote: The damage from this ability has been increased. In addition, Garrote now increases in potency with greater attack power.<br />
    * Relentless Strikes: This ability will no longer trigger when your finishing move does not hit your target.<br />
    * Rupture: Rupture now increases in potency with greater attack power.<br />
    * Sap: Enemy rogues will now always lose stealth when you Sap them. </p>
<p><strong>Shaman</strong></p>
<p>    * Reincarnation should now display the cooldown timer when used.<br />
    * Chain Heal &#8211; After the initial target is healed, the healing effect will jump to the most damaged target (by absolute health) within range. In addition, if a raid member is the initial target it will look for valid raid targets to jump to rather than non-raid targets as a priority, making it consistent with group targeted Chain Heals.<br />
    * Lightning Shield: Air Bubble pockets in underwater regions will no longer consume a charge from this spell. </p>
<p><strong>Warlocks</strong></p>
<p>    * Cripple (Doomguard): Due to haste effect change, the tooltip has been changed to 45%.<br />
    * Curse of Tongues: This spell will no longer debuff the target if they are immune to the spellcast slowing effect<br />
    * Enslave Demon: Due to haste effect change, the tooltip has been changed to 40%.<br />
    * Health Funnel: This spell will now work correctly on low-level enslaved demons.<br />
    * Howl of Terror: This spell now uses the same resistance checks as the Warlock spell Fear.<br />
    * Siphon Life will now properly gain a benefit from Shadow Mastery.<br />
    * A soul shard will be refunded to the caster any time a summoned pet despawns rather than dies.<br />
    * Aftermath: The effect of this talent will now still be placed on the victim if the caster is killed before their spell reaches the target.<br />
    * Improved Shadowbolt: The effect of this talent will now still be placed on the victim if the caster is killed before their spell reaches the target.<br />
    * Life Tap: This spell now benefits from effects which increase your spell damage. At rank 3 and above, the base amount of health lost and mana gained will increase by 80% of your bonus spell damage effects. Talents and items can further modify those values. Rank 1 and 2 receive reduced effect. </p>
<p><strong>Warriors</strong></p>
<p>    * Bloodthirst: This ability will now correctly benefit from attack power bonuses versus specific creature types.<br />
    * Flurry: The text on the tooltip has been corrected to indicate it triggers on all types of attacks.<br />
    * Shield Slam: This ability will sometimes no longer remove more than one beneficial effect from the target.<br />
    * Thunderclap: This ability was left at 10% despite the haste effect changes. This means its potency has been reduced slightly. </p>
<p><strong>Items</strong></p>
<p>    * +30 Spell Damage Enchantment: Fixed a bug with this enchantment which was preventing it from benefiting healing spells.<br />
    * Blade of Eternal Darkness: The triggered effect from this weapon will no longer occur when the spell being cast has its effect broken by causing damage.<br />
    * Blazefury Medallion: The triggered effect from this item will no longer break Gouge.<br />
    * Bonescythe Armor: The Eviscerate bonus will no longer trigger when your Eviscerate does not hit your target.<br />
    * Darkmoon Card- Twisting Nether: The dialog for this resurrection will now always reappear after the Spirit of Redemption effect has completed.<br />
    * Earthfury Set: The mana refund effect can now only occur once per Healing Wave spell cast.<br />
    * Earthshatter Set: The Lightning Shield bonus will now be removed if you lose the set bonus.<br />
    * Eye of the Dead: Holy Shock now interacts properly with this item.<br />
    * Ranged Elemental Damage: Our ranged combat system does not allow a ranged weapon to do a mix of Elemental (Fire, Frost, Arcane, etc.) and Physical damage. Many ranged weapons existed which were listed as doing Elemental damage and did not function properly (the damage was dealt, but was treated as Physical). All of those weapons have been changed to deliver the Elemental damage as a chance on hit effect. Hurricane was previously changed this way in 1.11. The following ranged weapons are also fixed in 1.12: Bow of Searing Arrows, Dwarven Hand Cannon, Heartseeking Crossbow, Dark Iron Rifle, Galgann&#8217;s Fireblaster, Quillshooter, Shell Launcher Shotgun, Venomstrike, and Verdant Keeper&#8217;s Aim.<br />
    * Talisman of Ascendance: This item will no longer trigger from physical damage effects. In addition, if either of the buffs from the item are canceled, they will both be canceled.<br />
    * Talisman of Ascendance: Holy Shock heals will now trigger the effect from this trinket.<br />
    * Zandalarian Hero Charm: Item tooltip corrected to match the effect tooltip.<br />
    * The Items that summon mounts have been changed in their color/quality. Items that summon normal mounts are now blue(superior)items and items that summon swift mounts are now purple(epic) items.<br />
    * Fixed a bug that allowed you to use items which restored health or mana while you were already full health or mana.<br />
