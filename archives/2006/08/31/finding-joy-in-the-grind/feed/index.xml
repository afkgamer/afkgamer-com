					<description><![CDATA[This one is particular to WSG and AB, mostly due to the decreased chance of getting mowed down by 15 people at once.

My favorite thing to do is to go Crippling poison mainhand, mindnumbing poison offhand and then sprint around putting it on the mages. And just moving on to another person, leaving them there to wallow in their deabilitated misery. In my experience, depoisoning just doesn&#039;t happen in BG&#039;s and these guys have just about nothing they can do once this has gone down. I&#039;ve seen mages get so frustrated with that combo of poisons they just suicide themselves into a warrior just to resurrect without that on them.]]></description>
