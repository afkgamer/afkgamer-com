					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s a takeaway I get from your experience: Someone trashing an old guild in an app needs to have a second (third and fourth) review. It&#039;s a red flag that should play a role in your decision-making process. Sometimes, people need to realize that the common denominator in all their failed relatoinships is: themselves.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You point out an all too common dilemma. The officers, in an attempt maintain harmony in the guild, shield the general grunts from the more drama-laden people/incidents. Later, when action must be taken to correct(assassinate as you put it) the core of the drama, the grunts are very confused as they do not have an idea about your reasoning. I&#039;ve found that making more of your smaller disciplinary issues extremely public will pay off. A lot of little dramas every now and again is better for a guild that a huge amount of drama later.]]></description>
