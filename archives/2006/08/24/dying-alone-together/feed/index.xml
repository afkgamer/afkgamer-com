					<description><![CDATA[There was this guy see.
He wasn&#039;t very bright and he reached his adult life without ever having learned &quot;the facts&quot;.
Somehow, it gets to be his wedding day.
While he is walking down the isle, his father tugs his sleeve and says,

&quot;Son, when you get to the hotel room...Call me&quot;

Hours later he gets to the hotel room with his beautiful blushing bride and he calls his father,

&quot;Dad, we are the hotel, what do I do?&quot;

&quot;O.K. Son, listen up, take off your clothes and get in the bed, then she should take off her clothes and get in the bed, if not help her. Then either way, ah, call me&quot;

A few moments later...

&quot;Dad we took off our clothes and we are in the bed, what do I do?&quot;

O.K. Son, listen up. Move real close to her and she should move real close to you, and then... Ah, call me.&quot;

A few moments later...

&quot;DAD! WE TOOK OFF OUR CLOTHES, GOT IN THE BED AND MOVED REAL CLOSE, WHAT DO I DO???&quot;

&quot;O.K. Son, Listen up, this is the most important part. Stick the long part of your body into the place where she goes to the bathroom.&quot;

A few moments later...

&quot;Dad, I&#039;ve got my foot in the toilet, what do I do?&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m in Battlegroup 6 and while there are some downsides to the new cross server battlegrounds, the experience has been very positive for me.  Arathi Basin was being run very infrequently outside of the holiday weekend on my server.  During peak hours the wait time for a battle would usually be ~30 minutes and when an AB would spawn it was almost always heavily outnumbered on one side (people queueing for both WSG and AB and then not joining the AB).  

Now there is usually around ~40 ABs running at any given time.  In addition to the sheer number of available instances, I face more pugs than organized groups and I have noticed a reduction in the number of lopsided games number wise.  The only downside that I&#039;ve noticed is that when pugging cross server, there is even less desire to work together and not much in the way of accountability.  A person&#039;s reputation on their own server is something that many regular PVPers would care about.  If you get a reputation as a good player or a good leader, you can use that to get yourself into one of the CP farming groups, and people are more likely to listen to you when you give orders in /general.  With the sheer volume of different people that you play with in a given night, no one knows or cares who you are. 

If there was a trash AFKer piece of shit in your BGs, at least the person would develop a bad rep and you could report them.  Now you just sort of have to deal with it.  People have also mentioned an increase in cheating, although if this is true I haven&#039;t noticed it yet, probably because I&#039;ve been in AB the whole time and most of the cheating seems to be occurring in WSG.]]></description>
