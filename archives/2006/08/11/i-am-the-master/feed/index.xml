					<description><![CDATA[[...] Updates, because everyone wants to know how the story ends: Recall the lying &#8220;I&#8217;m ebaying/IGEing&#8221; rogue that left our guild a few weeks back, immediately after the departure of two insurgents who tried to grab lasting guild power and failed. Whatever happened with all of that? Well, the rogue&#8217;s application to a rival guild was closed and denied that same day, as I wrote previously, and he eventually landed in a guild that we call, affectionately, the Guild for the Unguildables. Every member is a former member of a raiding guild and has &#8230; let&#8217;s say, baggage &#8230; in other words, a tattered reputation. [...]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[one comment from me, on my server it is actually pretty common for some of the &quot;top&quot; people to sell their characters once they quit.
Prices have been as high as 2k$ (though that was a full tier 2 warrior with TF back in the day when only about 40 guilds cleared bwl worldwide).

While i would never recruit someone who has bought an account i have never had hard feelings for those who sold and will gladly take them again in whatever game we play next.]]></description>
