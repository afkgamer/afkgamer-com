					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t really like human beings.  I have no friends and I really enjoy being alone.  I don&#039;t work, therefore I never meet anyone, which is a gift.  When I am in a shop though, I am polite and friendly towards people who work there. I am OK with the general public, but I never like personal contacts/friends.  Believe it or not, I always make people laugh.  When I am tired of people, I vanish.  So, how do I spend my time alone?  I memorise some poems, I read the classics, I make a wish list, I cook, I dress up and have tea parties - all by myself.  What a treat this life is!]]></description>
