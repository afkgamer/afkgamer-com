					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s funny that my subscription runs out for WoW (for at least a few months) in about a week, and in all this time I&#039;ve never been in the battlegrounds. I&#039;ve also never been in a serious guild and I&#039;ve never held a PVP rank higher than Private. 

I dunno, I just never took the game seriously enough. I always enjoyed playing WoW (ironically) with more than one person in the room.

Regardless, I certainly hope you get your billing accident.]]></description>
