					<description><![CDATA[Heh, I love the part where, in certain circumstances, &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=14051642&amp;postId=146511471&amp;sid=1#49&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;naked level 60s have to farm gold&lt;/a&gt; and/or reagents, nexus crystals etc. to get their gear restored.  

Are the realm economies that delicate, or is this latest keylogging incident that widespread?  I suppose a guild would come in handy in this situtaion, assuming the guildbank didn&#039;t get hijacked, and wouldn&#039;t that be a big score for the hijackers to nail a guildbank?  Scary.

I could have easily gotten burned by this scam -- I&#039;m careful, but I&#039;m not a fanatic about it.]]></description>
