					<description><![CDATA[Not particularly WoW specific, but:
1) Don&#039;t be ditch&#039;n yer beaux and taking off wid the guild leader. 
2) Leaders don&#039;t be buying gold - is a poor example.

  Unsurprisingly, most guilds don&#039;t feel the need to impose these upon their members. Tragically, those that do need, don&#039;t do it on account of the power corrupting thing. Dang.

  Wish I had had the balls to bail when the snoopy client was discovered, or I when discovered how important grinding is to this game (can&#039;t grind - fall asleep)... perhaps one of the periods of poor server stability. No, I bailed when the game *really* stopped being fun. 

  Being in a guild run by folks one knows IRL has its upsides - easy to arrange runs, easy to trust on loot... language gets moderated exactly to the level that folks can deal with very quickly. Shucks, my guild had a bunch of folks who could *think* very clearly - half the guild was techies IRL. Some of us worked together - we had been being paid (actual money) to work as a team for years.

  Sometimes the rpg feature can fail, real-life can intrude and one of the more important features of games - the ability to take one&#039;s mind off of of other stuff for a while - can become impossible to reestablish.
  Hacking, scripting, farming, gouging, Ninja-ing, camping, spamming, harrassing, and of course bugs, imbalances, sploitz, and general instablity - these *are* annoyances - they really are. 
  They just can&#039;t compete with life for the ability to piss one off.
  
  Grrr.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello fellow participant in the Carnival of Gamers!

I quit WoW a couple of months ago, but I understand what you mean about the Realm Forums.  We used them, though, as kind of a player test.  Players could flame, argue, post what they want, as long as they:
a) never attacked a person, only his (or her) behaviour and ideas,
b) never alleged that another player had broken the terms of use (that was a matter for guild leaders and/or Blizzard), and
c) never generalised a complaint beyond the specific circumstances they were making it in.

If they couldn&#039;t do that, they got warned.  If they did it twice, they got kicked.  That served as a really good way of publicising our guild and getting positive rep: we got a name for being polite, reasonable, and yet willing to engage in the community, and people could see that we&#039;d take fair action to remain that way.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Number 7 is most definitely advisable. 

I remember during the stupid war effort grind we attempting to get a couple of guilds on side for handing in stacks or various things. 

May as well have painted a big fat bullseye on our guild tabard for all the flaming we got for that little stunt. 

Interaction is now kept to a minimum realm forums.]]></description>
