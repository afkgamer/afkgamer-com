					<description><![CDATA[Some of my guild saw a sandstorm in Tanaris on the way to Silithus.  I was envious.  We tried to arrive in time to witness this phenom.  Alas and alack.

Also, we didn&#039;t get any Essence of Air.  Double ouch.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hear your pain :)

I saw some weather in Feralas, on the way to plinking around in Dire Maul last night.

Essentially ... meh.  I didn&#039;t like weather effects in EQ, and the rain in Feralas wasn&#039;t anything special.

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s not just raiding guilds that are geographically isolated.  A level 60 has no interest in Elwynn, Tirisfal, Dun Morogh, Darkshore, Alterac, STV, Tanaris or Feralas, save when a travel path takes them through those places.  High level gatherskillers may have an interest in Un&#039;goro and Winterspring, but for other 60s, there&#039;s still not much reason to visit those zones.

Because one level in WoW represents such a large increase in power (well, it&#039;s more sort of at the two-level mark, but let&#039;s pretend otherwise) zones are tuned for a very small range of levels.  If you&#039;re outside of that range, that zone is not interesting to you.  At level 60, all non-instance zones become uninteresting, because there&#039;s not a great deal of content other than dungeon crawling.

Even if every outdoor zone got weather, you&#039;d STILL never see it, because let&#039;s face it, we only leave the major cities to get into an instance.  And maybe to farm.]]></description>
