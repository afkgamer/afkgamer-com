					<description><![CDATA[The only research into a server&#039;s history that people can be reasonably expected to do:  is this a high pop or low pop server.  Many don&#039;t even go that far.

My guess on why the PVE to a PVP ruleset server transfers, they believe there&#039;s a huge demand for this and will eventually offer this to every PVE server?  For a fee? (Maybe vice versa also, PVP to new PVE ruleset server)  

Seems to me the huge demand right now is ... FIX THE DAMN SERVERS.  Either split server just about every one, or migrate everything to new hardware.  All effort should be focused on that, not testing out new markets, cheap bastards.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[They don&#039;t have to roll on those servers.  They can always decide to go somewhere else, instead.  It&#039;s not like they couldn&#039;t have found out that it would be happening from Blizzard&#039;s web page.

Besides, isn&#039;t Elwynn Forest an Alliance zone, not a contested zone, so alliance players can&#039;t be attacked by horde there?  I thought that&#039;s how the zones worked in PVP realms, but I don&#039;t play on &#039;em so I am not positive.

The servers aren&#039;t new.  They&#039;re old.  They may not have been started yet, but they&#039;ll be old.... lots of money, equipment, and high level characters.  If people don&#039;t want to do any research at all on the server before they roll on it, they really can&#039;t expect to wind up in newbie heaven.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sure there are no PvP newbie toons on that server now, but there will be by the end of the month. Those newbie toons will be so glad to have raid-equipped level 60&#039;s killing them for sport in Elwynn forest!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Regarding the PVE -&#062; PVP transfer.... it&#039;s a NEW PVP realm, there aren&#039;t any people who rolled new characters on it to be blindsided by an influx of high level, well equipped enemies.

I know I&#039;ve seen a few requests asking for transers off normal to PVP realms; so I suspect the demand is there.  People who transfer know (or should) what they&#039;re getting into, so it seems fair to me, since there&#039;s no current population who had to level up under PVP rules for it to be unfair to.]]></description>
