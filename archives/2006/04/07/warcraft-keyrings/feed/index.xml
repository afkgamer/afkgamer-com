					<description><![CDATA[Well from a TECHNICAL basis - they could still have it be a &quot;key&quot; and allow someone to open the door for others just not take up a bag slot. It&#039;s true though that in EQ2 the tendency is to have everyone need to be flagged for the zone (ala MC in WoW) - although they&#039;ve relaxed access restrictions for a lot of zones that no longer require completion of the access quest to get to.
Top 2 most hated things about WoW keys: forgetting it in the bank and the infamous &quot;here we are at UBRS now who has the key?&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The advantage of a key system as opposed to flagging a player for access is that the key system allows those who have the key to open the door to zones for those who don&#039;t have the key. The disadvantage is...well...we all know. =p]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Does the keyring actually take up a bag slot? I hated that whole &quot;forgot the key in the bank&quot; thing.
In EQ2 once you get access to a zone (complete the quest) you just have access to it from there on out. There is a screen you can bring up which shows you what zones you have unlocked but there is no item you need to lug around.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m simply astounded at the length of time it has taken to get this feature in.  And, it&#039;s more than just extra bag slots.  If we had extra bag slots, you&#039;d still get all the way to the locked instance door and say, &quot;Crap, I forgot the key in my bank&quot;.]]></description>
