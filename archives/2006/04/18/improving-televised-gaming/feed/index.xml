					<description><![CDATA[TV Gaming has potential, but every show I&#039;ve seen (with the exception of BiTs, in the UK) has been aimed at young teens, presented by adults who don&#039;t have a clue about games. Gaming is tricky in that many different &#039;crowds&#039; enjoy it. The dorm-room EA Sports and GTA player probably won&#039;t want to watch a show about geeky RPGs and Civ 4, and vice versa.

Still, I&#039;m sure music and movies had to take the time to hit their stride when it comes to TV programming.]]></description>
