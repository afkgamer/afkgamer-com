					<description><![CDATA[Regardless of whether the content is broken or just plain hard, is it really proper for a developer to be calling one of the big guilds a retard like that? It doesn&#039;t matter if he&#039;s &#039;off duty&#039; as it were, surely that&#039;s a really bad idea?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is that really what&#039;s going on here? Is it just a matter of the content being difficult? My main is still not level 60, so I haven&#039;t really done any endgame instances and I really am just wanting to know. 

If it&#039;s just a matter of being difficult, dtguild can take a flying leap. Frankly, I WANT my games to be difficult. If they are so difficult that even top guilds can&#039;t beat the content, yet, then great. That means a LOT of other people will get the chance to contribute to finding the perfect strategy to bring down C&#039;Thun. OTOH, if it really is a question of QA/playtesting, then admittedly, that is bad.

I really don&#039;t know, though. I&#039;m still LFG for my first BRD run.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with Tigole on this one(reading that second link): Just because you can&#039;t beat something doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s broken. The entity C&#039;Thun is an OLD GOD, for chrissakes! You can&#039;t just knock over a deity every day, you know.

No one can beat it... yet. It&#039;s just a matter of time. It&#039;s highly possible that the key to beating him has already been overlooked...]]></description>
