					<description><![CDATA[Yeah- the resistance to DKP systems always seems to be based on the worst DKP systems (which can get rather terrible).  Any well thought out DKP setup is actually going to reward the newer players, especially if they join an existing raiding guild that manages to clear any raid instances- older, well geared players won&#039;t want the gear from MC- they&#039;ll just be along to get points for AQ or BWL- newer players will get their pick of gear (similar to running the 5-man lvl 60 instances with raiders who go there for whatever reason- you can score 2-3 items per run, because they&#039;re not going for the same reasons you are).

The major things that get people up in arms about DKP- badly designed systems that permit collusion between older raiders (most auction-based systems, actually), and the painful changeover from non-raiding to raiding guild (especially with certain DKP setups, this can get exeptionally nasty- even the best setups really only work once you&#039;ve gotten to a stable point).]]></description>
