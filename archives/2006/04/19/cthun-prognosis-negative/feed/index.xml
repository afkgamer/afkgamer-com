					<description><![CDATA[Oh PLEASE Finster, it was a feked up encounter for a side boss. And C&#039;thun was pretty insane as well. This also gos with Blizzards usual method of &quot;We&#039;ll nerf if when we think we&#039;re ready for the boss to die&quot; game design style. It&#039;s happened with every big boss only this one got called out by the majority of the raiding community.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great. Now the next time some whiny-baby guild decides that they don&#039;t like Boss X or Feature Y, then all they have to do is post a profanity filled screed on their website that offers no constructive advice whatsoever. Then Blizzard will of course cave and do a bunch of stuff to capitulate to said loud-mouthed guild.

Ugh.]]></description>
