					<description><![CDATA[Well, I suppose if you do this as a job it would suck ass.  His points are probably valid if you are getting paid to do this.  I work as a volunteer for a online game site.  I don&#039;t get paid in cash but I get paid in games.  I can work at my own pace and the site I work for wants us to spend at least a month playing the game to get a good feel of it.  Any games I volunteer to write for I get to keep.  So, free games that I get to play and keep and I can write about how much I love them.... it&#039;s a dream job (or in this case, hobby).]]></description>
