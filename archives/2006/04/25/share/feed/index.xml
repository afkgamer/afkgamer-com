					<description><![CDATA[Meh, it&#039;s nothing personal against the survey. It&#039;s probably more my fault for following all those links and filling them out in the first place :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Aww...but I like the linky.  And unlike all the other surveys, I won&#039;t tell you if you&#039;re Gandalf or Legolas or a Blackrock Orc.  I&#039;ll just give you raw data from a poorly designed survey, and you can take that to the bank! :)

I understand, though, if you don&#039;t want to link to it or to respond.  It&#039;s entirely voluntary.  The only thing I can say in its defense is that I&#039;ve already found some very interesting insights into what players are looking for in MMOs.]]></description>
