					<description><![CDATA[Would a solution to lag in gaming be EVERY server given a ping limit of 50-60 for EVERY game. Problem solved? I play FPS and servers can be smooth until you get more than a few people join with pings of over 100ms. Worst pings I&#039;ve seen seem to come from Russia and Spain...but at night when the Americans start using European servers...wow. It&#039;s like lag city. My idea would encourage people to use servers in their own countries instead of lagging up others with gamers who want a decent lag free game. However, I&#039;m open to being completely wrong so I say this as more of a question than an answer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been following Bigfoot and End Lag Now for a few months now, and there is something I would like everyone to keep in mind. 

  They know something we don&#039;t. 

  They are not trying to sell us something that won&#039;t work in any reasonable manner, or trying to sell new network cards to people who are stupid enough to buy them, they just know something we don&#039;t.. And looks to me like they are making sure that it is true before they tell us.
 
  Stating that something is impossible in this day and age is silly. Think about technology progression over the last 10, even 5 years. If developers just gave up because people said it couldn&#039;t be done, then we would have nothing but Tetris to play. And, although fun, after 1183 lines in one sitting, it gets kinda old. 

  If they can do what they say, the people on the sidelines making snap judgements will probably claim they never doubted them. If they cannot, well.... I&#039;ll be the first to admit I was wrong, but I will not discredit someone who is spendig thier time finding a cure for cancer, just because I think they won&#039;t find it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not Lagging is all about great hardware and a great connection. The guy that runs Bigfoot Networks invented Intel&#039;s 10/100 NIC, which I run and like a lot. If their NIC improves performance it will inevitably improve lag... but to what degree?

They are pretty open on EndLagNow about being sponsored by Bigfoot, the CEO has a blog there. If they can actually get hardware companies to design with gamers in mind WTF, SLI is a combine of motherboard and graphics guys making our graphics better (just got SLI motherboard and one card.. next card coming soon)... and gaming with LESS LAG is way up on my list of stuff I want.

Totally agree it&#039;s like cancer it&#039;s never gonna end for everyone but shouldn&#039;t there be things available to those of us willing to spend some cash that actually help. Just get frustrated as hell with the amount of dough I drop into geek gear and still some games especially FPS stuff Lags! Even if Lag sticks around maybe we can atleast lag in much more complex environmets geared up for HD if overall Lag is reduced.

Anyway, Lag is a bitch.. glad someone is actually trying to help. Maybe for their next project they can come up with a card that kicks little kids of your server! No Lag, No Kids = Happy Capo!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This site wouldn&#039;t happen to be an attempt to sell the new proprietary network cards that Bigfoot is looking to sell to naive gamers, would it?

Unless they&#039;re creating a new end-to-end IP network with peering at datacenters with major MMOs and FPS servers, my lag won&#039;t change.]]></description>
